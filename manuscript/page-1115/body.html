<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> A mounted general separated himself from the infantry and approached Kutúzov. Of Kutúzov&rsquo;s suite only four remained. They were all pale and exchanged looks in silence.</p><p>&ldquo;Stop those wretches!&rdquo; gasped Kutúzov to the regimental commander, pointing to the flying soldiers; but at that instant, as if to punish him for those words, bullets flew hissing across the regiment and across Kutúzov&rsquo;s suite like a flock of little birds.</p><p>The French had attacked the battery and, seeing Kutúzov, were firing at him. After this volley the regimental commander clutched at his leg; several soldiers fell, and a second lieutenant who was holding the flag let it fall from his hands. It swayed and fell, but caught on the muskets of the nearest soldiers. The soldiers started firing without orders.</p></div> </div>
