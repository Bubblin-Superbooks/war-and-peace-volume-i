I&rsquo;ll dwive them off.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Attack indeed!&rdquo; said the colonel in a bored voice, puckering up his face as if driving off a troublesome fly. &ldquo;And why are you stopping here? Don&rsquo;t you see the skirmishers are retreating? Lead the squadron back.&rdquo;</p><p>The squadron crossed the bridge and drew out of range of fire without having lost a single man. The second squadron that had been in the front line followed them across and the last Cossacks quitted the farther side of the river.</p><p>The two Pávlograd squadrons, having crossed the bridge, retired up the hill one after the other. Their colonel, Karl Bogdánich Schubert, came up to Denísov&rsquo;s squadron and rode at a footpace not far from Rostóv, without taking any notice of him although they were now meeting for the first time since their encounter concerning Telyánin.</p></div> </div>
