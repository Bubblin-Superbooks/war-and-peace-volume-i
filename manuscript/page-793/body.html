He was afraid of getting some other officer into trouble, and silently fixed his eyes on Bagratión as a schoolboy who has blundered looks at an examiner.</p><p>The silence lasted some time. Prince Bagratión, apparently not wishing to be severe, found nothing to say; the others did not venture to intervene. Prince Andrew looked at Túshin from under his brows and his fingers twitched nervously.</p><p>&ldquo;Your excellency!&rdquo; Prince Andrew broke the silence with his abrupt voice, &ldquo;you were pleased to send me to Captain Túshin&rsquo;s battery. I went there and found two thirds of the men and horses knocked out, two guns smashed, and no supports at all.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
