He had often before, during the last six weeks, remained alone with her, but had never spoken to her of love. Now he felt that it was inevitable, but he could not make up his mind to take the final step. He felt ashamed; he felt that he was occupying someone else&rsquo;s place here beside Hélène. &ldquo;This happiness is not for you,&rdquo; some inner voice whispered to him. &ldquo;This happiness is for those who have not in them what there is in you.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
