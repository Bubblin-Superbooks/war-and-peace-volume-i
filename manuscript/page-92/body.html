Are you going to be a guardsman or a diplomatist?&rdquo; asked Prince Andrew after a momentary silence.</p><p>Pierre sat up on the sofa, with his legs tucked under him.</p><p>&ldquo;Really, I don&rsquo;t yet know. I don&rsquo;t like either the one or the other.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But you must decide on something! Your father expects it.&rdquo;</p><p>Pierre at the age of ten had been sent abroad with an abbé as tutor, and had remained away till he was twenty. When he returned to Moscow his father dismissed the abbé and said to the young man, &ldquo;Now go to Petersburg, look round, and choose your profession. I will agree to anything. Here is a letter to Prince Vasíli, and here is money. Write to me all about it, and I will help you in everything.</p></div> </div>
