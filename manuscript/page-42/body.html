As a clever maître d&rsquo;hôtel serves up as a specially choice delicacy a piece of meat that no one who had seen it in the kitchen would have cared to eat, so Anna Pávlovna served up to her guests, first the vicomte and then the abbé, as peculiarly choice morsels. The group about Mortemart immediately began discussing the murder of the Duc d&rsquo;Enghien. The vicomte said that the Duc d&rsquo;Enghien had perished by his own magnanimity, and that there were particular reasons for Buonaparte&rsquo;s hatred of him.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, yes! Do tell us all about it, Vicomte,&rdquo; said Anna Pávlovna, with a pleasant feeling that there was something à la Louis XV in the sound of that sentence: &ldquo;Contez nous çela, Vicomte.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
