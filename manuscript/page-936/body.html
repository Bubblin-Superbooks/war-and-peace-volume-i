On retiring to her own room, she sat in an armchair, her eyes fixed on a miniature portrait of her son on the lid of a snuffbox, while the tears kept coming into her eyes. Anna Mikháylovna, with the letter, came on tiptoe to the countess&rsquo; door and paused.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t come in,&rdquo; she said to the old count who was following her. &ldquo;Come later.&rdquo; And she went in, closing the door behind her.</p></div> </div>
