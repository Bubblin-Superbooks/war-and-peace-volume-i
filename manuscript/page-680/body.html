<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The road for the French from Vienna to Znaim was shorter and better than the road for the Russians from Krems to Znaim.</p><p>The night he received the news, Kutúzov sent Bagratión&rsquo;s vanguard, four thousand strong, to the right across the hills from the Krems-Znaim to the Vienna-Znaim road. Bagratión was to make this march without resting, and to halt facing Vienna with Znaim to his rear, and if he succeeded in forestalling the French he was to delay them as long as possible. Kutúzov himself with all his transport took the road to Znaim.</p><p>Marching thirty miles that stormy night across roadless hills, with his hungry, ill-shod soldiers, and losing a third of his men as stragglers by the way, Bagratión came out on the Vienna-Znaim road at Hollabrünn a few hours ahead of the French who were approaching Hollabrünn from Vienna.</p></div> </div>
