He closed his eyes and seemed to be dozing. His head sank forward and then he roused himself.</p><p>&ldquo;Aline,&rdquo; he said to his wife, &ldquo;go and see what they are about.&rdquo;</p><p>The princess went up to the door, passed by it with a dignified and indifferent air, and glanced into the little drawing room. Pierre and Hélène still sat talking just as before.</p><p>&ldquo;Still the same,&rdquo; she said to her husband.</p><p>Prince Vasíli frowned, twisting his mouth, his cheeks quivered and his face assumed the coarse, unpleasant expression peculiar to him.
