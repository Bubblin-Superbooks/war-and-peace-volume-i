It will give you no trouble and is nothing unworthy of you, but it will comfort me. Promise, Andr√∫sha!...&rdquo; said she, putting her hand in her reticule but not yet taking out what she was holding inside it, as if what she held were the subject of her request and must not be shown before the request was granted.</p></div> </div>
