The jaunty infantry officer who just before the battle had rushed out of Túshin&rsquo;s wattle shed was laid, with a bullet in his stomach, on &ldquo;Matvévna&rsquo;s&rdquo; carriage. At the foot of the hill, a pale hussar cadet, supporting one hand with the other, came up to Túshin and asked for a seat.</p><p>&ldquo;Captain, for God&rsquo;s sake! I&rsquo;ve hurt my arm,&rdquo; he said timidly. &ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake... I can&rsquo;t walk. For God&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
