It expressed the concentrated and happy resolution you see on the face of a man who on a hot day takes a final run before plunging into the water. The dull, sleepy expression was no longer there, nor the affectation of profound thought. The round, steady, hawk&rsquo;s eyes looked before him eagerly and rather disdainfully, not resting on anything although his movements were still slow and measured.</p><p>The commander of the regiment turned to Prince Bagratión, entreating him to go back as it was too dangerous to remain where they were. &ldquo;Please, your excellency, for God&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo; he kept saying, glancing for support at an officer of the suite who turned away from him.</p></div> </div>
