Kutúzov himself, he was told, was in the house with Prince Bagratión and Weyrother. Weyrother was the Austrian general who had succeeded Schmidt. In the passage little Kozlóvski was squatting on his heels in front of a clerk. The clerk, with cuffs turned up, was hastily writing at a tub turned bottom upwards. Kozlóvski&rsquo;s face looked worn&mdash;he too had evidently not slept all night. He glanced at Prince Andrew and did not even nod to him.</p></div> </div>
