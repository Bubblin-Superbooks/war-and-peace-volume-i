But, my dear, will you not give us a little hope of touching this heart, so kind and generous? Say &lsquo;perhaps&rsquo;... The future is so long. Say &lsquo;perhaps.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Prince, what I have said is all there is in my heart. I thank you for the honor, but I shall never be your son&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, so that&rsquo;s finished, my dear fellow! I am very glad to have seen you. Very glad! Go back to your rooms, Princess. Go!&rdquo; said the old prince. &ldquo;Very, very glad to have seen you,&rdquo; repeated he, embracing Prince Vasíli.</p></div> </div>
