<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Kutúzov, with his uniform unbuttoned so that his fat neck bulged over his collar as if escaping, was sitting almost asleep in a low chair, with his podgy old hands resting symmetrically on its arms. At the sound of Weyrother&rsquo;s voice, he opened his one eye with an effort.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, if you please! It is already late,&rdquo; said he, and nodding his head he let it droop and again closed his eye.</p><p>If at first the members of the council thought that Kutúzov was pretending to sleep, the sounds his nose emitted during the reading that followed proved that the commander in chief at that moment was absorbed by a far more serious matter than a desire to show his contempt for the dispositions or anything else&mdash;he was engaged in satisfying the irresistible human need for sleep. He really was asleep.</p></div> </div>
