<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The attack of the Sixth Chasseurs secured the retreat of our right flank. In the center Túshin&rsquo;s forgotten battery, which had managed to set fire to the Schön Grabern village, delayed the French advance. The French were putting out the fire which the wind was spreading, and thus gave us time to retreat. The retirement of the center to the other side of the dip in the ground at the rear was hurried and noisy, but the different companies did not get mixed. But our left&mdash;which consisted of the Azóv and Podólsk infantry and the Pávlograd hussars&mdash;was simultaneously attacked and outflanked by superior French forces under Lannes and was thrown into confusion. Bagratión had sent Zherkóv to the general commanding that left flank with orders to retreat immediately.</p></div> </div>
