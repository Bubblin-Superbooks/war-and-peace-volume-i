<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>On the twelfth of November, Kutúzov&rsquo;s active army, in camp before Olmütz, was preparing to be reviewed next day by the two Emperors&mdash;the Russian and the Austrian. The Guards, just arrived from Russia, spent the night ten miles from Olmütz and next morning were to come straight to the review, reaching the field at Olmütz by ten o&rsquo;clock.</p><p>That day Nicholas Rostóv received a letter from Borís, telling him that the Ismáylov regiment was quartered for the night ten miles from Olmütz and that he wanted to see him as he had a letter and money for him. Rostóv was particularly in need of money now that the troops, after their active service, were stationed near Olmütz and the camp swarmed with well-provisioned sutlers and Austrian Jews offering all sorts of tempting wares.</p></div> </div>
