<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I am glad I was able to do you a service, my dear Anna Mikháylovna,&rdquo; said Prince Vasíli, arranging his lace frill, and in tone and manner, here in Moscow to Anna Mikháylovna whom he had placed under an obligation, assuming an air of much greater importance than he had done in Petersburg at Anna Schérer&rsquo;s reception.</p><p>&ldquo;Try to serve well and show yourself worthy,&rdquo; added he, addressing Borís with severity. &ldquo;I am glad.... Are you here on leave?&rdquo; he went on in his usual tone of indifference.</p><p>&ldquo;I am awaiting orders to join my new regiment, your excellency,&rdquo; replied Borís, betraying neither annoyance at the prince&rsquo;s brusque manner nor a desire to enter into conversation, but speaking so quietly and respectfully that the prince gave him a searching glance.</p></div> </div>
