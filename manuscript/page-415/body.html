<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like your Mademoiselle Bourienne at all,&rdquo; said Prince Andrew.</p><p>&ldquo;No? She is very nice and kind and, above all, she&rsquo;s much to be pitied. She has no one, no one. To tell the truth, I don&rsquo;t need her, and she&rsquo;s even in my way. You know I always was a savage, and now am even more so. I like being alone.... Father likes her very much. She and Michael Iv√°novich are the two people to whom he is always gentle and kind, because he has been a benefactor to them both. As Sterne says: &lsquo;We don&rsquo;t love people so much for the good they have done us, as for the good we have done them.&rsquo; Father took her when she was homeless after losing her own father. She is very good-natured, and my father likes her way of reading. She reads to him in the evenings and reads splendidly.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
