They were both so busy as to seem not to notice one another. When having limbered up the only two cannon that remained uninjured out of the four, they began moving down the hill (one shattered gun and one unicorn were left behind), Prince Andrew rode up to Túshin.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, till we meet again...&rdquo; he said, holding out his hand to Túshin.</p><p>&ldquo;Good-by, my dear fellow,&rdquo; said Túshin. &ldquo;Dear soul! Good-by, my dear fellow!&rdquo; and for some unknown reason tears suddenly filled his eyes.</p></div> </div>
