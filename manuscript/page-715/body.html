<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &ldquo;It has begun! Here it is, dreadful but enjoyable!&rdquo; was what the face of each soldier and each officer seemed to say.</p><p>Before he had reached the embankments that were being thrown up, he saw, in the light of the dull autumn evening, mounted men coming toward him. The foremost, wearing a Cossack cloak and lambskin cap and riding a white horse, was Prince Bagratión. Prince Andrew stopped, waiting for him to come up; Prince Bagratión reined in his horse and recognizing Prince Andrew nodded to him. He still looked ahead while Prince Andrew told him what he had seen.</p><p>The feeling, &ldquo;It has begun! Here it is!&rdquo; was seen even on Prince Bagratión&rsquo;s hard brown face with its half-closed, dull, sleepy eyes. Prince Andrew gazed with anxious curiosity at that impassive face and wished he could tell what, if anything, this man was thinking and feeling at that moment.</p></div> </div>
