Do you suppose I... who could think?... I know very well...&rdquo;</p><p>But Borís again interrupted him.</p><p>&ldquo;I am glad I have spoken out fully. Perhaps you did not like it? You must excuse me,&rdquo; said he, putting Pierre at ease instead of being put at ease by him, &ldquo;but I hope I have not offended you. I always make it a rule to speak out... Well, what answer am I to take? Will you come to dinner at the Rostóvs&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
