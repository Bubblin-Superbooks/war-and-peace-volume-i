<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> As soon as Bonaparte (who was at Schönbrunn, sixteen miles from Hollabrünn) received Murat&rsquo;s dispatch with the proposal of a truce and a capitulation, he detected a ruse and wrote the following letter to Murat:</p><p>Schönbrunn, 25th Brumaire, 1805,</p><p>at eight o&rsquo;clock in the morning</p><p>To PRINCE MURAT,</p><p>I cannot find words to express to you my displeasure. You command only my advance guard, and have no right to arrange an armistice without my order. You are causing me to lose the fruits of a campaign. Break the armistice immediately and march on the enemy. Inform him that the general who signed that capitulation had no right to do so, and that no one but the Emperor of Russia has that right.</p></div> </div>
