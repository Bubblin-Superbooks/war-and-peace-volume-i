One soldier moved and then another and soon the whole battalion ran forward shouting &ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; and overtook him. A sergeant of the battalion ran up and took the flag that was swaying from its weight in Prince Andrew&rsquo;s hands, but he was immediately killed. Prince Andrew again seized the standard and, dragging it by the staff, ran on with the battalion. In front he saw our artillerymen, some of whom were fighting, while others, having abandoned their guns, were running toward him. He also saw French infantry soldiers who were seizing the artillery horses and turning the guns round. Prince Andrew and the battalion were already within twenty paces of the cannon.</p></div> </div>
