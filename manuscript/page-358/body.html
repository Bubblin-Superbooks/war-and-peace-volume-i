<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The princess looked in a scared way at her father&rsquo;s eyes glittering close to her; the red patches on her face came and went, and it was plain that she understood nothing and was so frightened that her fear would prevent her understanding any of her father&rsquo;s further explanations, however clear they might be. Whether it was the teacher&rsquo;s fault or the pupil&rsquo;s, this same thing happened every day: the princess&rsquo; eyes grew dim, she could not see and could not hear anything, but was only conscious of her stern father&rsquo;s withered face close to her, of his breath and the smell of him, and could think only of how to get away quickly to her own room to make out the problem in peace.</p></div> </div>
