Véra was good-looking, not at all stupid, quick at learning, was well brought up, and had a pleasant voice; what she said was true and appropriate, yet, strange to say, everyone&mdash;the visitors and countess alike&mdash;turned to look at her as if wondering why she had said it, and they all felt awkward.</p><p>&ldquo;People are always too clever with their eldest children and try to make something exceptional of them,&rdquo; said the visitor.</p></div> </div>
