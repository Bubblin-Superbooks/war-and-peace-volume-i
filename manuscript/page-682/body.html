<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Murat declared that negotiations for peace were already proceeding, and that he therefore offered this truce to avoid unnecessary bloodshed. Count Nostitz, the Austrian general occupying the advanced posts, believed Murat&rsquo;s emissary and retired, leaving Bagratión&rsquo;s division exposed. Another emissary rode to the Russian line to announce the peace negotiations and to offer the Russian army the three days&rsquo; truce. Bagratión replied that he was not authorized either to accept or refuse a truce and sent his adjutant to Kutúzov to report the offer he had received.</p><p>A truce was Kutúzov&rsquo;s sole chance of gaining time, giving Bagratión&rsquo;s exhausted troops some rest, and letting the transport and heavy convoys (whose movements were concealed from the French) advance if but one stage nearer Znaim. The offer of a truce gave the only, and a quite unexpected, chance of saving the army.</p></div> </div>
