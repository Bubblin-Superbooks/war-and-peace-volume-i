<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;My vocation is a different one,&rdquo; thought Princess Mary. &ldquo;My vocation is to be happy with another kind of happiness, the happiness of love and self-sacrifice. And cost what it may, I will arrange poor Am√©lie&rsquo;s happiness, she loves him so passionately, and so passionately repents. I will do all I can to arrange the match between them. If he is not rich I will give her the means; I will ask my father and Andrew. I shall be so happy when she is his wife. She is so unfortunate, a stranger, alone, helpless! And, oh God, how passionately she must love him if she could so far forget herself! Perhaps I might have done the same!...&rdquo; thought Princess Mary.</p></div> </div>
