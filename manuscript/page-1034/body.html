<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;There will be a council of war at Kutúzov&rsquo;s tonight, though; you can say all this there,&rdquo; remarked Dolgorúkov.</p><p>&ldquo;I will do so,&rdquo; said Prince Andrew, moving away from the map.</p><p>&ldquo;Whatever are you bothering about, gentlemen?&rdquo; said Bilíbin, who, till then, had listened with an amused smile to their conversation and now was evidently ready with a joke. &ldquo;Whether tomorrow brings victory or defeat, the glory of our Russian arms is secure. Except your Kutúzov, there is not a single Russian in command of a column! The commanders are: Herr General Wimpfen, le Comte de Langeron, le Prince de Lichtenstein, le Prince, de Hohenlohe, and finally Prishprish, and so on like all those Polish names.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
