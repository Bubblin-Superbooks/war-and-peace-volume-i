Halfway across stood Prince Nesvítski, who had alighted from his horse and whose big body was jammed against the railings. He looked back laughing to the Cossack who stood a few steps behind him holding two horses by their bridles. Each time Prince Nesvítski tried to move on, soldiers and carts pushed him back again and pressed him against the railings, and all he could do was to smile.</p><p>&ldquo;What a fine fellow you are, friend!&rdquo; said the Cossack to a convoy soldier with a wagon, who was pressing onto the infantrymen who were crowded together close to his wheels and his horses. &ldquo;What a fellow! You can&rsquo;t wait a moment! Don&rsquo;t you see the general wants to pass?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
