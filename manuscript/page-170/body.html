I have heard that it harms the voice to train it at that age.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh no, not at all too young!&rdquo; replied the count. &ldquo;Why, our mothers used to be married at twelve or thirteen.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And she&rsquo;s in love with Borís already. Just fancy!&rdquo; said the countess with a gentle smile, looking at Borís and went on, evidently concerned with a thought that always occupied her: &ldquo;Now you see if I were to be severe with her and to forbid it ... goodness knows what they might be up to on the sly&rdquo; (she meant that they would be kissing), &ldquo;but as it is, I know every word she utters. She will come running to me of her own accord in the evening and tell me everything. Perhaps I spoil her, but really that seems the best plan. With her elder sister I was stricter.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
