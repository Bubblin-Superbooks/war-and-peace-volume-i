Before he came up with the hussars, several adjutants met him with news of the successful result of the action.</p><p>This battle, which consisted in the capture of a French squadron, was represented as a brilliant victory over the French, and so the Emperor and the whole army, especially while the smoke hung over the battlefield, believed that the French had been defeated and were retreating against their will.
