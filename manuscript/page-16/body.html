I confess all these festivities and fireworks are becoming wearisome.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If they had known that you wished it, the entertainment would have been put off,&rdquo; said the prince, who, like a wound-up clock, by force of habit said things he did not even wish to be believed.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tease! Well, and what has been decided about Novos√≠ltsev&rsquo;s dispatch? You know everything.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What can one say about it?&rdquo; replied the prince in a cold, listless tone. &ldquo;What has been decided? They have decided that Buonaparte has burnt his boats, and I believe that we are ready to burn ours.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
