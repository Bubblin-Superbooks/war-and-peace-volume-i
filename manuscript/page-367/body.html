<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>t even know), the matchmaking chronicles of Moscow now speak of me as the future Countess Bezúkhova. But you will understand that I have no desire for the post. À propos of marriages: do you know that a while ago that universal auntie Anna Mikháylovna told me, under the seal of strict secrecy, of a plan of marriage for you. It is neither more nor less than with Prince Vasíli&rsquo;s son Anatole, whom they wish to reform by marrying him to someone rich and distinguée, and it is on you that his relations&rsquo; choice has fallen. I don&rsquo;t know what you will think of it, but I consider it my duty to let you know of it. He is said to be very handsome and a terrible scapegrace. That is all I have been able to find out about him.</p></div> </div>
