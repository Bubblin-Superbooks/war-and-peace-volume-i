Can I see him?&rdquo; asked Pierre, awkwardly as usual, but unabashed.</p><p>&ldquo;The count is suffering physically and mentally, and apparently you have done your best to increase his mental sufferings.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Can I see the count?&rdquo; Pierre again asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Hm.... If you wish to kill him, to kill him outright, you can see him... Olga, go and see whether Uncle&rsquo;s beef tea is ready&mdash;it is almost time,&rdquo; she added, giving Pierre to understand that they were busy, and busy making his father comfortable, while evidently he, Pierre, was only busy causing him annoyance.</p></div> </div>
