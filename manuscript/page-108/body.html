<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Never, never marry, my dear fellow! That&rsquo;s my advice: never marry till you can say to yourself that you have done all you are capable of, and until you have ceased to love the woman of your choice and have seen her plainly as she is, or else you will make a cruel and irrevocable mistake. Marry when you are old and good for nothing&mdash;or all that is good and noble in you will be lost. It will all be wasted on trifles. Yes! Yes! Yes! Don&rsquo;t look at me with such surprise. If you marry expecting anything from yourself in the future, you will feel at every step that for you all is ended, all is closed except the drawing room, where you will be ranged side by side with a court lackey and an idiot!... But what&rsquo;s the good?...&rdquo; and he waved his arm.</p></div> </div>
