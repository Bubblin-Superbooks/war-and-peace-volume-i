<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;And I will tell you this,&rdquo; Prince Andrew interrupted in a tone of quiet authority, &ldquo;you wish to insult me, and I am ready to agree with you that it would be very easy to do so if you haven&rsquo;t sufficient self-respect, but admit that the time and place are very badly chosen. In a day or two we shall all have to take part in a greater and more serious duel, and besides, Drubetskóy, who says he is an old friend of yours, is not at all to blame that my face has the misfortune to displease you. However,&rdquo; he added rising, &ldquo;you know my name and where to find me, but don&rsquo;t forget that I do not regard either myself or you as having been at all insulted, and as a man older than you, my advice is to let the matter drop. Well then, on Friday after the review I shall expect you, Drubetskóy. Au revoir!&rdquo; exclaimed Prince Andrew, and with a bow to them both he went out.</p></div> </div>
