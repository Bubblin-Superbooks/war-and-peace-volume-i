<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>And like a practical Petersburg lady who knows how to make the most of time, Anna Mikháylovna sent someone to call her son, and went into the anteroom with him.</p><p>&ldquo;Good-by, my dear,&rdquo; said she to the countess who saw her to the door, and added in a whisper so that her son should not hear, &ldquo;Wish me good luck.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you going to Count Cyril Vladímirovich, my dear?&rdquo; said the count coming out from the dining hall into the anteroom, and he added: &ldquo;If he is better, ask Pierre to dine with us. He has been to the house, you know, and danced with the children. Be sure to invite him, my dear. We will see how Tarás distinguishes himself today. He says Count Orlóv never gave such a dinner as ours will be!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
