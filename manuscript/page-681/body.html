<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Kutúzov with his transport had still to march for some days before he could reach Znaim. Hence Bagratión with his four thousand hungry, exhausted men would have to detain for days the whole enemy army that came upon him at Hollabrünn, which was clearly impossible. But a freak of fate made the impossible possible. The success of the trick that had placed the Vienna bridge in the hands of the French without a fight led Murat to try to deceive Kutúzov in a similar way. Meeting Bagratión&rsquo;s weak detachment on the Znaim road he supposed it to be Kutúzov&rsquo;s whole army. To be able to crush it absolutely he awaited the arrival of the rest of the troops who were on their way from Vienna, and with this object offered a three days&rsquo; truce on condition that both armies should remain in position without moving.</p></div> </div>
