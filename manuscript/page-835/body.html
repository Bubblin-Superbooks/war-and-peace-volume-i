He began the rescript again and again, but as soon as he uttered &lsquo;Sergéy&rsquo; he sobbed, &lsquo;Kuz-mí-ch,&rsquo; tears, and &lsquo;From all sides&rsquo; was smothered in sobs and he could get no farther. And again his handkerchief, and again: &lsquo;Sergéy Kuzmích, From all sides,&rsquo;... and tears, till at last somebody else was asked to read it.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
