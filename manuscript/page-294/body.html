One must think of the future, of all of you... I love you all, like children of my own, as you know.&rdquo;</p><p>The princess continued to look at him without moving, and with the same dull expression.</p><p>&ldquo;And then of course my family has also to be considered,&rdquo; Prince Vasíli went on, testily pushing away a little table without looking at her. &ldquo;You know, Catiche, that we&mdash;you three sisters, Mámontov, and my wife&mdash;are the count&rsquo;s only direct heirs. I know, I know how hard it is for you to talk or think of such matters. It is no easier for me; but, my dear, I am getting on for sixty and must be prepared for anything.</p></div> </div>
