The story told about him at Count Rostóv&rsquo;s was true. Pierre had taken part in tying a policeman to a bear. He had now been for some days in Moscow and was staying as usual at his father&rsquo;s house. Though he expected that the story of his escapade would be already known in Moscow and that the ladies about his father&mdash;who were never favorably disposed toward him&mdash;would have used it to turn the count against him, he nevertheless on the day of his arrival went to his father&rsquo;s part of the house. Entering the drawing room, where the princesses spent most of their time, he greeted the ladies, two of whom were sitting at embroidery frames while a third read aloud. It was the eldest who was reading&mdash;the one who had met Anna Mikháylovna.</p></div> </div>
