Lëlya... I am very pleased.&rdquo; (His voice trembled.) &ldquo;I loved your father... and she will make you a good wife... God bless you!...&rdquo;</p><p>He embraced his daughter, and then again Pierre, and kissed him with his malodorous mouth. Tears actually moistened his cheeks.</p><p>&ldquo;Princess, come here!&rdquo; he shouted.</p><p>The old princess came in and also wept. The elderly lady was using her handkerchief too. Pierre was kissed, and he kissed the beautiful Hélène&rsquo;s hand several times. After a while they were left alone again.</p></div> </div>
