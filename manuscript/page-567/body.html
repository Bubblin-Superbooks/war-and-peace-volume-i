I&rsquo;m going into action! I&rsquo;ve shaved, bwushed my teeth, and scented myself.&rdquo;</p><p>The imposing figure of Nesvítski followed by his Cossack, and the determination of Denísov who flourished his sword and shouted frantically, had such an effect that they managed to squeeze through to the farther side of the bridge and stopped the infantry. Beside the bridge Nesvítski found the colonel to whom he had to deliver the order, and having done this he rode back.</p></div> </div>
