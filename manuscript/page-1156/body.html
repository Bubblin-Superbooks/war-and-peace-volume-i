<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Get onto the ice, over the ice! Go on! Turn! Don&rsquo;t you hear? Go on!&rdquo; innumerable voices suddenly shouted after the ball had struck the general, the men themselves not knowing what, or why, they were shouting.</p><p>One of the hindmost guns that was going onto the dam turned off onto the ice. Crowds of soldiers from the dam began running onto the frozen pond. The ice gave way under one of the foremost soldiers, and one leg slipped into the water. He tried to right himself but fell in up to his waist. The nearest soldiers shrank back, the gun driver stopped his horse, but from behind still came the shouts: &ldquo;Onto the ice, why do you stop? Go on! Go on!&rdquo; And cries of horror were heard in the crowd. The soldiers near the gun waved their arms and beat the horses to make them turn and move on. The horses moved off the bank.</p></div> </div>
