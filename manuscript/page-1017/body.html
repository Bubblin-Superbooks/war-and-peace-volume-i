<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> In the market place, where there had been some rather heavy firing before the Emperor&rsquo;s arrival, lay several killed and wounded soldiers whom there had not been time to move. The Emperor, surrounded by his suite of officers and courtiers, was riding a bobtailed chestnut mare, a different one from that which he had ridden at the review, and bending to one side he gracefully held a gold lorgnette to his eyes and looked at a soldier who lay prone, with blood on his uncovered head. The wounded soldier was so dirty, coarse, and revolting that his proximity to the Emperor shocked Rostóv. Rostóv saw how the Emperor&rsquo;s rather round shoulders shuddered as if a cold shiver had run down them, how his left foot began convulsively tapping the horse&rsquo;s side with the spur, and how the well-trained horse looked round unconcerned and did not stir.</p></div> </div>
