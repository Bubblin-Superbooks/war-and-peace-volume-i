<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Moreau would have been a prisoner if Suvórov had had a free hand; but he had the Hofs-kriegs-wurst-schnapps-Rath on his hands. It would have puzzled the devil himself! When you get there you&rsquo;ll find out what those Hofs-kriegs-wurst-Raths are! Suvórov couldn&rsquo;t manage them so what chance has Michael Kutúzov? No, my dear boy,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;you and your generals won&rsquo;t get on against Buonaparte; you&rsquo;ll have to call in the French, so that birds of a feather may fight together. The German, Pahlen, has been sent to New York in America, to fetch the Frenchman, Moreau,&rdquo; he said, alluding to the invitation made that year to Moreau to enter the Russian service.... &ldquo;Wonderful!... Were the Potëmkins, Suvórovs, and Orlóvs Germans? No, lad, either you fellows have all lost your wits, or I have outlived mine. May God help you, but we&rsquo;ll see what will happen. Buonaparte has become a great commander among them! Hm!...&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
