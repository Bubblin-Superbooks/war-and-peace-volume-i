In the first moment of Pierre&rsquo;s outburst Anna PÃ¡vlovna, despite her social experience, was horror-struck. But when she saw that Pierre&rsquo;s sacrilegious words had not exasperated the vicomte, and had convinced herself that it was impossible to stop him, she rallied her forces and joined the vicomte in a vigorous attack on the orator.</p><p>&ldquo;But, my dear Monsieur Pierre,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;how do you explain the fact of a great man executing a duc&mdash;or even an ordinary man who&mdash;is innocent and untried?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I should like,&rdquo; said the vicomte, &ldquo;to ask how monsieur explains the 18th Brumaire; was not that an imposture? It was a swindle, and not at all like the conduct of a great man!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
