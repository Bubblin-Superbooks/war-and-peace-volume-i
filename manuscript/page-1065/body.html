One was on a white horse. Prince Bagratión and Prince Dolgorúkov with their adjutants had come to witness the curious phenomenon of the lights and shouts in the enemy&rsquo;s camp. Rostóv rode up to Bagratión, reported to him, and then joined the adjutants listening to what the generals were saying.</p><p>&ldquo;Believe me,&rdquo; said Prince Dolgorúkov, addressing Bagratión, &ldquo;it is nothing but a trick! He has retreated and ordered the rearguard to kindle fires and make a noise to deceive us.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
