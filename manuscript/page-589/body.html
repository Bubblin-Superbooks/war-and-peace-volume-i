Who&rsquo;ll get there first? Will they get there and fire the bridge or will the French get within grapeshot range and wipe them out?&rdquo; These were the questions each man of the troops on the high ground above the bridge involuntarily asked himself with a sinking heart&mdash;watching the bridge and the hussars in the bright evening light and the blue tunics advancing from the other side with their bayonets and guns.</p></div> </div>
