<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;To be quite frank, Mary, I expect Father&rsquo;s character sometimes makes things trying for you, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Prince Andrew asked suddenly.</p><p>Princess Mary was first surprised and then aghast at this question.</p><p>&ldquo;For me? For me?... Trying for me!...&rdquo; said she.</p><p>&ldquo;He always was rather harsh; and now I should think he&rsquo;s getting very trying,&rdquo; said Prince Andrew, apparently speaking lightly of their father in order to puzzle or test his sister.</p><p>&ldquo;You are good in every way, Andrew, but you have a kind of intellectual pride,&rdquo; said the princess, following the train of her own thoughts rather than the trend of the conversation&mdash;&ldquo;and that&rsquo;s a great sin. How can one judge Father? But even if one might, what feeling except veneration could such a man as my father evoke? And I am so contented and happy with him. I only wish you were all as happy as I am.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
