He had been so excited that he had not thought about it until that moment. The officers&rsquo; laughter confused him still more. He stood before Bagratión with his lower jaw trembling and was hardly able to mutter: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know... your excellency... I had no men... your excellency.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
