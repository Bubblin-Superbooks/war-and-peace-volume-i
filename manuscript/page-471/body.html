A drummer, their leader, turned round facing the singers, and flourishing his arm, began a long-drawn-out soldiers&rsquo; song, commencing with the words: &ldquo;Morning dawned, the sun was rising,&rdquo; and concluding: &ldquo;On then, brothers, on to glory, led by Father Kámenski.&rdquo; This song had been composed in the Turkish campaign and now being sung in Austria, the only change being that the words &ldquo;Father Kámenski&rdquo; were replaced by &ldquo;Father Kutúzov.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
