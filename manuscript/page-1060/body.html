On this knoll there was a white patch that Rostóv could not at all make out: was it a glade in the wood lit up by the moon, or some unmelted snow, or some white houses? He even thought something moved on that white spot. &ldquo;I expect it&rsquo;s snow... that spot... a spot&mdash;une tache,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;There now... it&rsquo;s not a tache... Natásha... sister, black eyes... Na... tasha... (Won&rsquo;t she be surprised when I tell her how I&rsquo;ve seen the Emperor?) Natásha... take my sabretache...&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Keep to the right, your honor, there are bushes here,&rdquo; came the voice of an hussar, past whom Rostóv was riding in the act of falling asleep. Rostóv lifted his head that had sunk almost to his horse&rsquo;s mane and pulled up beside the hussar.</p></div> </div>
