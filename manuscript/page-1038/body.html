<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Shortly after nine o&rsquo;clock that evening, Weyrother drove with his plans to Kutúzov&rsquo;s quarters where the council of war was to be held. All the commanders of columns were summoned to the commander in chief&rsquo;s and with the exception of Prince Bagratión, who declined to come, were all there at the appointed time.</p><p>Weyrother, who was in full control of the proposed battle, by his eagerness and briskness presented a marked contrast to the dissatisfied and drowsy Kutúzov, who reluctantly played the part of chairman and president of the council of war. Weyrother evidently felt himself to be at the head of a movement that had already become unrestrainable. He was like a horse running downhill harnessed to a heavy cart. Whether he was pulling it or being pushed by it he did not know, but rushed along at headlong speed with no time to consider what this movement might lead to.</p></div> </div>
