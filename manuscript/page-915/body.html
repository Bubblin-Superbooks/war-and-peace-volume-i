She lowered her head and was ready to burst into tears.</p><p>&ldquo;Now then, now then, I&rsquo;m only joking!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Remember this, Princess, I hold to the principle that a maiden has a full right to choose.

Never mind me!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But I do not know, Father!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need to talk! He receives his orders and will marry you or anybody; but you are free to choose....
