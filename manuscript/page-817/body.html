She looked at her niece, as if inquiring what she was to do with these people. On leaving them, Anna Pávlovna again touched Pierre&rsquo;s sleeve, saying: &ldquo;I hope you won&rsquo;t say that it is dull in my house again,&rdquo; and she glanced at Hélène.</p><p>Hélène smiled, with a look implying that she did not admit the possibility of anyone seeing her without being enchanted.
