I have already dispatched mine. I have written to my poor mother,&rdquo; said the smiling Mademoiselle Bourienne rapidly, in her pleasant mellow tones and with guttural r&rsquo;s. She brought into Princess Mary&rsquo;s strenuous, mournful, and gloomy world a quite different atmosphere, careless, lighthearted, and self-satisfied.</p><p>&ldquo;Princess, I must warn you,&rdquo; she added, lowering her voice and evidently listening to herself with pleasure, and speaking with exaggerated grasseyement, &ldquo;the prince has been scolding Michael Iv√°novich. He is in a very bad humor, very morose. Be prepared.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
