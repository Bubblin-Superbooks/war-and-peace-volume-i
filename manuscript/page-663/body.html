<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> A soldier was driving, and a woman enveloped in shawls sat behind the apron under the leather hood of the vehicle. Prince Andrew rode up and was just putting his question to a soldier when his attention was diverted by the desperate shrieks of the woman in the vehicle. An officer in charge of transport was beating the soldier who was driving the woman&rsquo;s vehicle for trying to get ahead of others, and the strokes of his whip fell on the apron of the equipage. The woman screamed piercingly. Seeing Prince Andrew she leaned out from behind the apron and, waving her thin arms from under the woolen shawl, cried:</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Aide-de-camp! Mr. Aide-de-camp!... For heaven&rsquo;s sake... Protect me! What will become of us? I am the wife of the doctor of the Seventh Chasseurs.... They won&rsquo;t let us pass, we are left behind and have lost our people...&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
