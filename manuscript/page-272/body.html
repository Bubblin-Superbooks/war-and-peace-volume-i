<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Sónya, don&rsquo;t believe her, darling! Don&rsquo;t believe her! Do you remember how we and Nicholas, all three of us, talked in the sitting room after supper? Why, we settled how everything was to be. I don&rsquo;t quite remember how, but don&rsquo;t you remember that it could all be arranged and how nice it all was? There&rsquo;s Uncle Shinshín&rsquo;s brother has married his first cousin. And we are only second cousins, you know. And Borís says it is quite possible. You know I have told him all about it. And he is so clever and so good!&rdquo; said Natásha. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you cry, Sónya, dear love, darling Sónya!&rdquo; and she kissed her and laughed. &ldquo;Véra&rsquo;s spiteful; never mind her! And all will come right and she won&rsquo;t say anything to Mamma. Nicholas will tell her himself, and he doesn&rsquo;t care at all for Julie.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
