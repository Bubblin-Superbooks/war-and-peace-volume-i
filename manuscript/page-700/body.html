It&rsquo;s fine!&rdquo; answered Sídorov, who was considered an adept at French.</p><p>The soldier to whom the laughers referred was Dólokhov. Prince Andrew recognized him and stopped to listen to what he was saying. Dólokhov had come from the left flank where their regiment was stationed, with his captain.</p><p>&ldquo;Now then, go on, go on!&rdquo; incited the officer, bending forward and trying not to lose a word of the speech which was incomprehensible to him. &ldquo;More, please: more! What&rsquo;s he saying?&rdquo;</p><p>Dólokhov did not answer the captain; he had been drawn into a hot dispute with the French grenadier. They were naturally talking about the campaign. The Frenchman, confusing the Austrians with the Russians, was trying to prove that the Russians had surrendered and had fled all the way from Ulm, while Dólokhov maintained that the Russians had not surrendered but had beaten the French.</p></div> </div>
