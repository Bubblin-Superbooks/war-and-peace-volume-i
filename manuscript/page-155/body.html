<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>This black-eyed, wide-mouthed girl, not pretty but full of life&mdash;with childish bare shoulders which after her run heaved and shook her bodice, with black curls tossed backward, thin bare arms, little legs in lace-frilled drawers, and feet in low slippers&mdash;was just at that charming age when a girl is no longer a child, though the child is not yet a young woman. Escaping from her father she ran to hide her flushed face in the lace of her mother&rsquo;s mantilla&mdash;not paying the least attention to her severe remark&mdash;and began to laugh. She laughed, and in fragmentary sentences tried to explain about a doll which she produced from the folds of her frock.</p></div> </div>
