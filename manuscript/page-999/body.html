However, dear fellow,&rdquo; he said abruptly and eagerly, &ldquo;I must confess to having been unjust to the Austrians and especially to Weyrother. What exactitude, what minuteness, what knowledge of the locality, what foresight for every eventuality, every possibility even to the smallest detail! No, my dear fellow, no conditions better than our present ones could have been devised. This combination of Austrian precision with Russian valor&mdash;what more could be wished for?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
