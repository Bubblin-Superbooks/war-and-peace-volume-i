<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> When I want to see one of those big people I write a note: &lsquo;Princess So-and-So desires an interview with So and-So,&rsquo; and then I take a cab and go myself two, three, or four times&mdash;till I get what I want. I don&rsquo;t mind what they think of me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, and to whom did you apply about Bóry?&rdquo; asked the countess. &ldquo;You see yours is already an officer in the Guards, while my Nicholas is going as a cadet. There&rsquo;s no one to interest himself for him. To whom did you apply?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To Prince Vasíli. He was so kind. He at once agreed to everything, and put the matter before the Emperor,&rdquo; said Princess Anna Mikháylovna enthusiastically, quite forgetting all the humiliation she had endured to gain her end.</p></div> </div>
