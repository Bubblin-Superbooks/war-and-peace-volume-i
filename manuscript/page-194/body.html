It&rsquo;s a burden to him, and Bóry&rsquo;s life is only just beginning....&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Surely he will leave something to Borís,&rdquo; said the countess.</p><p>&ldquo;Heaven only knows, my dear! These rich grandees are so selfish. Still, I will take Borís and go to see him at once, and I shall speak to him straight out.
