<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Like wind over leaves ran an excited whisper: &ldquo;They&rsquo;re coming! They&rsquo;re coming!&rdquo; Alarmed voices were heard, and a stir of final preparation swept over all the troops.</p><p>From the direction of Olm√ºtz in front of them, a group was seen approaching. And at that moment, though the day was still, a light gust of wind blowing over the army slightly stirred the streamers on the lances and the unfolded standards fluttered against their staffs. It looked as if by that slight motion the army itself was expressing its joy at the approach of the Emperors. One voice was heard shouting: &ldquo;Eyes front!&rdquo; Then, like the crowing of cocks at sunrise, this was repeated by others from various sides and all became silent.</p></div> </div>
