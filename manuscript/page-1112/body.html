My turn has come,&rdquo; thought Prince Andrew, and striking his horse he rode up to Kutúzov.</p><p>&ldquo;The Ápsherons must be stopped, your excellency,&rdquo; cried he.

All&rsquo;s lost!&rdquo; And at this as if at a command, everyone began to run.</p><p>Confused and ever-increasing crowds were running back to where five minutes before the troops had passed the Emperors.
