<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Behind the company the sound of wheels, the creaking of springs, and the tramp of horses&rsquo; hoofs were heard. Kutúzov and his suite were returning to the town. The commander in chief made a sign that the men should continue to march at ease, and he and all his suite showed pleasure at the sound of the singing and the sight of the dancing soldier and the gay and smartly marching men. In the second file from the right flank, beside which the carriage passed the company, a blue-eyed soldier involuntarily attracted notice. It was Dólokhov marching with particular grace and boldness in time to the song and looking at those driving past as if he pitied all who were not at that moment marching with the company. The hussar cornet of Kutúzov&rsquo;s suite who had mimicked the regimental commander, fell back from the carriage and rode up to Dólokhov.</p></div> </div>
