<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> One officer told Rost贸v that he had seen someone from headquarters behind the village to the left, and thither Rost贸v rode, not hoping to find anyone but merely to ease his conscience. When he had ridden about two miles and had passed the last of the Russian troops, he saw, near a kitchen garden with a ditch round it, two men on horseback facing the ditch. One with a white plume in his hat seemed familiar to Rost贸v; the other on a beautiful chestnut horse (which Rost贸v fancied he had seen before) rode up to the ditch, struck his horse with his spurs, and giving it the rein leaped lightly over. Only a little earth crumbled from the bank under the horse&rsquo;s hind hoofs. Turning the horse sharply, he again jumped the ditch, and deferentially addressed the horseman with the white plumes, evidently suggesting that he should do the same.</p></div> </div>
