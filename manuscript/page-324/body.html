<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Prince Vas√≠li in front of the door, near the invalid chair, a wax taper in his left hand, was leaning his left arm on the carved back of a velvet chair he had turned round for the purpose, and was crossing himself with his right hand, turning his eyes upward each time he touched his forehead. His face wore a calm look of piety and resignation to the will of God. &ldquo;If you do not understand these sentiments,&rdquo; he seemed to be saying, &ldquo;so much the worse for you!&rdquo;</p><p>Behind him stood the aide-de-camp, the doctors, and the menservants; the men and women had separated as in church. All were silently crossing themselves, and the reading of the church service, the subdued chanting of deep bass voices, and in the intervals sighs and the shuffling of feet were the only sounds that could be heard.</p></div> </div>
