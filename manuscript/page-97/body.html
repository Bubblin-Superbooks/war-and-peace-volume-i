Prince Andrew shook himself as if waking up, and his face assumed the look it had had in Anna PÃ¡vlovna&rsquo;s drawing room. Pierre removed his feet from the sofa. The princess came in. She had changed her gown for a house dress as fresh and elegant as the other. Prince Andrew rose and politely placed a chair for her.</p><p>&ldquo;How is it,&rdquo; she began, as usual in French, settling down briskly and fussily in the easy chair, &ldquo;how is it Annette never got married? How stupid you men all are not to have married her! Excuse me for saying so, but you have no sense about women. What an argumentative fellow you are, Monsieur Pierre!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
