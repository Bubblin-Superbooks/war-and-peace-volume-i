Yes, for that alone! I shall never tell anyone, but, oh God! what am I to do if I love nothing but fame and men&rsquo;s esteem? Death, wounds, the loss of family&mdash;I fear nothing. And precious and dear as many persons are to me&mdash;father, sister, wife&mdash;those dearest to me&mdash;yet dreadful and unnatural as it seems, I would give them all at once for a moment of glory, of triumph over men, of love from men I don&rsquo;t know and never shall know, for the love of these men here,&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
