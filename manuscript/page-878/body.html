How am I to renounce forever these vile fancies, so as peacefully to fulfill Thy will?&rdquo; And scarcely had she put that question than God gave her the answer in her own heart. &ldquo;Desire nothing for thyself, seek nothing, be not anxious or envious. Man&rsquo;s future and thy own fate must remain hidden from thee, but live so that thou mayest be ready for anything. If it be God&rsquo;s will to prove thee in the duties of marriage, be ready to fulfill His will.&rdquo; With this consoling thought (but yet with a hope for the fulfillment of her forbidden earthly longing) Princess Mary sighed, and having crossed herself went down, thinking neither of her gown and coiffure nor of how she would go in nor of what she would say.</p></div> </div>
