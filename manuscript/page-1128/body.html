<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The Horse Guards were galloping, but still holding in their horses. Rostóv could already see their faces and heard the command: &ldquo;Charge!&rdquo; shouted by an officer who was urging his thoroughbred to full speed. Rostóv, fearing to be crushed or swept into the attack on the French, galloped along the front as hard as his horse could go, but still was not in time to avoid them.</p><p>The last of the Horse Guards, a huge pockmarked fellow, frowned angrily on seeing Rostóv before him, with whom he would inevitably collide. This Guardsman would certainly have bowled Rostóv and his Bedouin over (Rostóv felt himself quite tiny and weak compared to these gigantic men and horses) had it not occurred to Rostóv to flourish his whip before the eyes of the Guardsman&rsquo;s horse.</p></div> </div>
