From all sides... and then tears,&rdquo; someone repeated laughing.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be unkind,&rdquo; cried Anna Pávlovna from her end of the table holding up a threatening finger. &ldquo;He is such a worthy and excellent man, our dear Vyazmítinov....&rdquo;</p><p>Everybody laughed a great deal. At the head of the table, where the honored guests sat, everyone seemed to be in high spirits and under the influence of a variety of exciting sensations. Only Pierre and Hélène sat silently side by side almost at the bottom of the table, a suppressed smile brightening both their faces, a smile that had nothing to do with Sergéy Kuzmích&mdash;a smile of bashfulness at their own feelings.</p></div> </div>
