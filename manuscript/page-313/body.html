I will look after your interests,&rdquo; said she in reply to his look, and went still faster along the passage.</p><p>Pierre could not make out what it was all about, and still less what &ldquo;watching over his interests&rdquo; meant, but he decided that all these things had to be. From the passage they went into a large, dimly lit room adjoining the count&rsquo;s reception room. It was one of those sumptuous but cold apartments known to Pierre only from the front approach, but even in this room there now stood an empty bath, and water had been spilled on the carpet. They were met by a deacon with a censer and by a servant who passed out on tiptoe without heeding them. They went into the reception room familiar to Pierre, with two Italian windows opening into the conservatory, with its large bust and full length portrait of Catherine the Great.</p></div> </div>
