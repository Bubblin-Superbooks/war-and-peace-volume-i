<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Having thanked Anna Pávlovna for her charming soiree, the guests began to take their leave.</p><p>Pierre was ungainly. Stout, about the average height, broad, with huge red hands; he did not know, as the saying is, how to enter a drawing room and still less how to leave one; that is, how to say something particularly agreeable before going away. Besides this he was absent-minded. When he rose to go, he took up instead of his own, the general&rsquo;s three-cornered hat, and held it, pulling at the plume, till the general asked him to restore it. All his absent-mindedness and inability to enter a room and converse in it was, however, redeemed by his kindly, simple, and modest expression. Anna Pávlovna turned toward him and, with a Christian mildness that expressed forgiveness of his indiscretion, nodded and said: &ldquo;I hope to see you again, but I also hope you will change your opinions, my dear Monsieur Pierre.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
