At last she rang.</p><p>&ldquo;What is the matter with you, my dear?&rdquo; she said crossly to the maid who kept her waiting some minutes. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you wish to serve me? Then I&rsquo;ll find you another place.&rdquo;</p><p>The countess was upset by her friend&rsquo;s sorrow and humiliating poverty, and was therefore out of sorts, a state of mind which with her always found expression in calling her maid &ldquo;my dear&rdquo; and speaking to her with exaggerated politeness.</p></div> </div>
