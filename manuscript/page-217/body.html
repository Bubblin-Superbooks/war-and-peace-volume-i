Only fancy, I didn&rsquo;t know you at first. Do you remember how we went to the Sparrow Hills with Madame Jacquot?... It&rsquo;s such an age...&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You are mistaken,&rdquo; said Borís deliberately, with a bold and slightly sarcastic smile. &ldquo;I am Borís, son of Princess Anna Mikháylovna Drubetskáya. Rostóv, the father, is Ilyá, and his son is Nicholas. I never knew any Madame Jacquot.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
