Anna Mikháylovna, addressing a maid who was hurrying past with a decanter on a tray as &ldquo;my dear&rdquo; and &ldquo;my sweet,&rdquo; asked about the princess&rsquo; health and then led Pierre along a stone passage. The first door on the left led into the princesses&rsquo; apartments.</p></div> </div>
