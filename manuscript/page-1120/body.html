<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Above him there was now nothing but the sky&mdash;the lofty sky, not clear yet still immeasurably lofty, with gray clouds gliding slowly across it. &ldquo;How quiet, peaceful, and solemn; not at all as I ran,&rdquo; thought Prince Andrew&mdash;&ldquo;not as we ran, shouting and fighting, not at all as the gunner and the Frenchman with frightened and angry faces struggled for the mop: how differently do those clouds glide across that lofty infinite sky! How was it I did not see that lofty sky before? And how happy I am to have found it at last! Yes! All is vanity, all falsehood, except that infinite sky. There is nothing, nothing, but that. But even it does not exist, there is nothing but quiet and peace. Thank God!...&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
