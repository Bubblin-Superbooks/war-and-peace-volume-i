Husband? Can it be possible?&rdquo; she thought, not daring to look at his face, but still feeling his eyes gazing at her.</p><p>In the evening, after supper, when all were about to retire, Anatole kissed Princess Mary&rsquo;s hand. She did not know how she found the courage, but she looked straight into his handsome face as it came near to her shortsighted eyes. Turning from Princess Mary he went up and kissed Mademoiselle Bourienne&rsquo;s hand. (This was not etiquette, but then he did everything so simply and with such assurance!) Mademoiselle Bourienne flushed, and gave the princess a frightened look.</p></div> </div>
