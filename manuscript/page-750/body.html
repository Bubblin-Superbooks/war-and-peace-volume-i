<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Suddenly something like a birch broom seemed to sweep over the squadron. Rostóv raised his saber, ready to strike, but at that instant the trooper Nikítenko, who was galloping ahead, shot away from him, and Rostóv felt as in a dream that he continued to be carried forward with unnatural speed but yet stayed on the same spot. From behind him Bondarchúk, an hussar he knew, jolted against him and looked angrily at him. Bondarchúk&rsquo;s horse swerved and galloped past.</p><p>&ldquo;How is it I am not moving? I have fallen, I am killed!&rdquo; Rostóv asked and answered at the same instant. He was alone in the middle of a field. Instead of the moving horses and hussars&rsquo; backs, he saw nothing before him but the motionless earth and the stubble around him. There was warm blood under his arm. &ldquo;No, I am wounded and the horse is killed.</p></div> </div>
