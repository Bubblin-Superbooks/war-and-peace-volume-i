Oh, how you have....&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your doctor tells you to go to bed earlier,&rdquo; said Prince Andrew. &ldquo;You had better go.&rdquo;</p><p>The princess said nothing, but suddenly her short downy lip quivered. Prince Andrew rose, shrugged his shoulders, and walked about the room.</p><p>Pierre looked over his spectacles with na√Øve surprise, now at him and now at her, moved as if about to rise too, but changed his mind.</p><p>&ldquo;Why should I mind Monsieur Pierre being here?&rdquo; exclaimed the little princess suddenly, her pretty face all at once distorted by a tearful grimace. &ldquo;I have long wanted to ask you, Andrew, why you have changed so to me? What have I done to you? You are going to the war and have no pity for me. Why is it?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
