Oh!&rdquo; and she shook her finger at him, &ldquo;I have even heard of your doings in Paris!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And didn&rsquo;t Hippolyte tell you?&rdquo; asked Prince Vas√≠li, turning to his son and seizing the little princess&rsquo; arm as if she would have run away and he had just managed to catch her, &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t he tell you how he himself was pining for the dear princess, and how she showed him the door? Oh, she is a pearl among women, Princess,&rdquo; he added, turning to Princess Mary.</p></div> </div>
