Prince Andrew forced his way to him.</p><p>&ldquo;You are wounded?&rdquo; he asked, hardly able to master the trembling of his lower jaw.</p><p>&ldquo;The wound is not here, it is there!&rdquo; said Kutúzov, pressing the handkerchief to his wounded cheek and pointing to the fleeing soldiers. &ldquo;Stop them!&rdquo; he shouted, and at the same moment, probably realizing that it was impossible to stop them, spurred his horse and rode to the right.</p></div> </div>
