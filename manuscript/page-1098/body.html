The colonel at the head of the regiment was much surprised at the commander in chief&rsquo;s order to throw out skirmishers. He had felt perfectly sure that there were other troops in front of him and that the enemy must be at least six miles away. There was really nothing to be seen in front except a barren descent hidden by dense mist. Having given orders in the commander in chief&rsquo;s name to rectify this omission, Prince Andrew galloped back.</p></div> </div>
