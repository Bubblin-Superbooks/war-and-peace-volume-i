Pierre, who from the moment Prince Andrew entered the room had watched him with glad, affectionate eyes, now came up and took his arm. Before he looked round Prince Andrew frowned again, expressing his annoyance with whoever was touching his arm, but when he saw Pierre&rsquo;s beaming face he gave him an unexpectedly kind and pleasant smile.</p><p>&ldquo;There now!... So you, too, are in the great world?&rdquo; said he to Pierre.</p><p>&ldquo;I knew you would be here,&rdquo; replied Pierre. &ldquo;I will come to supper with you. May I?&rdquo; he added in a low voice so as not to disturb the vicomte who was continuing his story.</p></div> </div>
