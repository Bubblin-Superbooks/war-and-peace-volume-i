Leave it to those who are no longer fit for anything else.... You have not been ordered to return and have not been dismissed from here; therefore, you can stay and go with us wherever our ill luck takes us. They say we are going to Olmütz, and Olmütz is a very decent town. You and I will travel comfortably in my calèche.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do stop joking, Bilíbin,&rdquo; cried Bolkónski.</p></div> </div>
