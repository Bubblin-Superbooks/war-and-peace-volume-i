<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Bring us nice news of a victory by the Archduke Karl or Ferdinand (one archduke&rsquo;s as good as another, as you know) and even if it is only over a fire brigade of Bonaparte&rsquo;s, that will be another story and we&rsquo;ll fire off some cannon! But this sort of thing seems done on purpose to vex us. The Archduke Karl does nothing, the Archduke Ferdinand disgraces himself. You abandon Vienna, give up its defense&mdash;as much as to say: &lsquo;Heaven is with us, but heaven help you and your capital!&rsquo; The one general whom we all loved, Schmidt, you expose to a bullet, and then you congratulate us on the victory! Admit that more irritating news than yours could not have been conceived. It&rsquo;s as if it had been done on purpose, on purpose.</p></div> </div>
