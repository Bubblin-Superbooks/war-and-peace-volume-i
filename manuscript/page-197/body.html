<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;My dear Borís,&rdquo; said Princess Anna Mikháylovna to her son as Countess Rostóva&rsquo;s carriage in which they were seated drove over the straw covered street and turned into the wide courtyard of Count Cyril Vladímirovich Bezúkhov&rsquo;s house. &ldquo;My dear Borís,&rdquo; said the mother, drawing her hand from beneath her old mantle and laying it timidly and tenderly on her son&rsquo;s arm, &ldquo;be affectionate and attentive to him. Count Cyril Vladímirovich is your godfather after all, and your future depends on him. Remember that, my dear, and be nice to him, as you so well know how to be.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If only I knew that anything besides humiliation would come of it...&rdquo; answered her son coldly. &ldquo;But I have promised and will do it for your sake.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
