<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>On the Pratzen Heights, where he had fallen with the flagstaff in his hand, lay Prince Andrew Bolk√≥nski bleeding profusely and unconsciously uttering a gentle, piteous, and childlike moan.</p><p>Toward evening he ceased moaning and became quite still. He did not know how long his unconsciousness lasted. Suddenly he again felt that he was alive and suffering from a burning, lacerating pain in his head.</p><p>&ldquo;Where is it, that lofty sky that I did not know till now, but saw today?&rdquo; was his first thought. &ldquo;And I did not know this suffering either,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;Yes, I did not know anything, anything at all till now. But where am I?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
