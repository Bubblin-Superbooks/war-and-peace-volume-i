Count!&rdquo; shouted Berg who ran up from the other side as eager as Borís. &ldquo;Count! I am wounded in my right hand&rdquo; (and he showed his bleeding hand with a handkerchief tied round it) &ldquo;and I remained at the front. I held my sword in my left hand, Count. All our family&mdash;the von Bergs&mdash;have been knights!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
