The case is this: you ought to have thought the matter over and taken advice; but no, you go and blurt it all straight out before the officers. Now what was the colonel to do? Have the officer tried and disgrace the whole regiment? Disgrace the whole regiment because of one scoundrel? Is that how you look at it? We don&rsquo;t see it like that. And Bogdánich was a brick: he told you you were saying what was not true. It&rsquo;s not pleasant, but what&rsquo;s to be done, my dear fellow? You landed yourself in it.</p></div> </div>
