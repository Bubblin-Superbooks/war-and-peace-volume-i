The turrets of a convent stood out beyond a wild virgin pine forest, and far away on the other side of the Enns the enemy&rsquo;s horse patrols could be discerned.</p><p>Among the field guns on the brow of the hill the general in command of the rearguard stood with a staff officer, scanning the country through his fieldglass. A little behind them Nesv√≠tski, who had been sent to the rearguard by the commander in chief, was sitting on the trail of a gun carriage.</p></div> </div>
