<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;It would be good,&rdquo; thought Prince Andrew, glancing at the icon his sister had hung round his neck with such emotion and reverence, &ldquo;it would be good if everything were as clear and simple as it seems to Mary. How good it would be to know where to seek for help in this life, and what to expect after it beyond the grave! How happy and calm I should be if I could now say: &lsquo;Lord, have mercy on me!&rsquo;... But to whom should I say that? Either to a Power indefinable, incomprehensible, which I not only cannot address but which I cannot even express in words&mdash;the Great All or Nothing-&rdquo; said he to himself, &ldquo;or to that God who has been sewn into this amulet by Mary! There is nothing certain, nothing at all except the unimportance of everything I understand, and the greatness of something incomprehensible but all-important.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
