<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Rostóv, absorbed by his relations with Bogdánich, had paused on the bridge not knowing what to do. There was no one to hew down (as he had always imagined battles to himself), nor could he help to fire the bridge because he had not brought any burning straw with him like the other soldiers. He stood looking about him, when suddenly he heard a rattle on the bridge as if nuts were being spilt, and the hussar nearest to him fell against the rails with a groan. Rostóv ran up to him with the others. Again someone shouted, &ldquo;Stretchers!&rdquo; Four men seized the hussar and began lifting him.</p><p>&ldquo;Oooh! For Christ&rsquo;s sake let me alone!&rdquo; cried the wounded man, but still he was lifted and laid on the stretcher.</p></div> </div>
