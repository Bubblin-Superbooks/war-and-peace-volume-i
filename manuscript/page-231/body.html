<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Dmítri, a man of good family who had been brought up in the count&rsquo;s house and now managed all his affairs, stepped softly into the room.</p><p>&ldquo;This is what I want, my dear fellow,&rdquo; said the count to the deferential young man who had entered. &ldquo;Bring me...&rdquo; he reflected a moment, &ldquo;yes, bring me seven hundred rubles, yes! But mind, don&rsquo;t bring me such tattered and dirty notes as last time, but nice clean ones for the countess.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, Dmítri, clean ones, please,&rdquo; said the countess, sighing deeply.</p><p>&ldquo;When would you like them, your excellency?&rdquo; asked Dmítri. &ldquo;Allow me to inform you... But, don&rsquo;t be uneasy,&rdquo; he added, noticing that the count was beginning to breathe heavily and quickly which was always a sign of approaching anger. &ldquo;I was forgetting... Do you wish it brought at once?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
