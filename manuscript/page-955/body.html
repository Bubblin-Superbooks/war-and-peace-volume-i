Do go somewhere, anywhere... to the devil!&rdquo; he exclaimed, and immediately seizing him by the shoulder and looking amiably into his face, evidently wishing to soften the rudeness of his words, he added, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be hurt, my dear fellow; you know I speak from my heart as to an old acquaintance.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t mention it, Count! I quite understand,&rdquo; said Berg, getting up and speaking in a muffled and guttural voice.</p></div> </div>
