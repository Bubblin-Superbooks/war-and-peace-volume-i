The general with the bandaged head bent forward as though running away from some danger, and, making long, quick strides with his thin legs, went up to Kutúzov.</p><p>&ldquo;Vous voyez le malheureux Mack,&rdquo; he uttered in a broken voice.</p><p>Kutúzov&rsquo;s face as he stood in the open doorway remained perfectly immobile for a few moments. Then wrinkles ran over his face like a wave and his forehead became smooth again, he bowed his head respectfully, closed his eyes, silently let Mack enter his room before him, and closed the door himself behind him.</p></div> </div>
