<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Come over here, Hélène, dear,&rdquo; said Anna Pávlovna to the beautiful young princess who was sitting some way off, the center of another group.</p><p>The princess smiled. She rose with the same unchanging smile with which she had first entered the room&mdash;the smile of a perfectly beautiful woman. With a slight rustle of her white dress trimmed with moss and ivy, with a gleam of white shoulders, glossy hair, and sparkling diamonds, she passed between the men who made way for her, not looking at any of them but smiling on all, as if graciously allowing each the privilege of admiring her beautiful figure and shapely shoulders, back, and bosom&mdash;which in the fashion of those days were very much exposed&mdash;and she seemed to bring the glamour of a ballroom with her as she moved toward Anna Pávlovna.</p></div> </div>
