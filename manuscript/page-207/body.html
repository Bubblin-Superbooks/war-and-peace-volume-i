Ah, it is awful: the duties of a Christian...&rdquo;</p><p>A door of one of the inner rooms opened and one of the princesses, the count&rsquo;s niece, entered with a cold, stern face. The length of her body was strikingly out of proportion to her short legs. Prince Vasíli turned to her.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, how is he?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Still the same; but what can you expect, this noise...&rdquo; said the princess, looking at Anna Mikháylovna as at a stranger.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, my dear, I hardly knew you,&rdquo; said Anna Mikháylovna with a happy smile, ambling lightly up to the count&rsquo;s niece. &ldquo;I have come, and am at your service to help you nurse my uncle. I imagine what you have gone through,&rdquo; and she sympathetically turned up her eyes.</p></div> </div>
