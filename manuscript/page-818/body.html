Pierre was so used to that smile, and it had so little meaning for him, that he paid no attention to it. The aunt was just speaking of a collection of snuffboxes that had belonged to Pierre&rsquo;s father, Count Bezúkhov, and showed them her own box. Princess Hélène asked to see the portrait of the aunt&rsquo;s husband on the box lid.</p><p>&ldquo;That is probably the work of Vinesse,&rdquo; said Pierre, mentioning a celebrated miniaturist, and he leaned over the table to take the snuffbox while trying to hear what was being said at the other table.</p></div> </div>
