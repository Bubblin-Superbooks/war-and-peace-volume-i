And so it was decided to send the letters and money by the Grand Duke&rsquo;s courier to Borís and Borís was to forward them to Nicholas. The letters were from the old count, the countess, Pétya, Véra, Natásha, and Sónya, and finally there were six thousand rubles for his outfit and various other things the old count sent to his son.</p></div> </div>
