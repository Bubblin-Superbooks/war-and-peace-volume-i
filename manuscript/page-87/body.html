<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I am very glad I did not go to the ambassador&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said Prince Hippolyte &ldquo;&mdash;so dull&mdash;. It has been a delightful evening, has it not? Delightful!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They say the ball will be very good,&rdquo; replied the princess, drawing up her downy little lip. &ldquo;All the pretty women in society will be there.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not all, for you will not be there; not all,&rdquo; said Prince Hippolyte smiling joyfully; and snatching the shawl from the footman, whom he even pushed aside, he began wrapping it round the princess. Either from awkwardness or intentionally (no one could have said which) after the shawl had been adjusted he kept his arm around her for a long time, as though embracing her.</p></div> </div>
