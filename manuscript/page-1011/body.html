The French dragoon was a young Alsatian who spoke French with a German accent. He was breathless with agitation, his face was red, and when he heard some French spoken he at once began speaking to the officers, addressing first one, then another. He said he would not have been taken, it was not his fault but the corporal&rsquo;s who had sent him to seize some horsecloths, though he had told him the Russians were there. And at every word he added: &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t hurt my little horse!&rdquo; and stroked the animal. It was plain that he did not quite grasp where he was.</p></div> </div>
