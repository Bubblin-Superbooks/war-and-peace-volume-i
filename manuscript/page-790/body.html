How was it that two guns were abandoned in the center?&rdquo; he inquired, searching with his eyes for someone. (Prince Bagrati√≥n did not ask about the guns on the left flank; he knew that all the guns there had been abandoned at the very beginning of the action.) &ldquo;I think I sent you?&rdquo; he added, turning to the staff officer on duty.</p><p>&ldquo;One was damaged,&rdquo; answered the staff officer, &ldquo;and the other I can&rsquo;t understand. I was there all the time giving orders and had only just left.... It is true that it was hot there,&rdquo; he added, modestly.</p></div> </div>
