Her hair was carefully done and her face was animated, which, however, did not conceal its sunken and faded outlines. Dressed as she used to be in Petersburg society, it was still more noticeable how much plainer she had become. Some unobtrusive touch had been added to Mademoiselle Bourienne&rsquo;s toilet which rendered her fresh and pretty face yet more attractive.</p><p>&ldquo;What! Are you going to remain as you are, dear princess?&rdquo; she began. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be announcing that the gentlemen are in the drawing room and we shall have to go down, and you have not smartened yourself up at all!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
