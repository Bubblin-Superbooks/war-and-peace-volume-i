Mary!...&rdquo; they suddenly exclaimed, and then laughed. &ldquo;I dreamed last night...&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;You were not expecting us?...&rdquo; &ldquo;Ah! Mary, you have got thinner?...&rdquo; &ldquo;And you have grown stouter!...&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I knew the princess at once,&rdquo; put in Mademoiselle Bourienne.</p><p>&ldquo;And I had no idea!...&rdquo; exclaimed Princess Mary. &ldquo;Ah, Andrew, I did not see you.&rdquo;</p><p>Prince Andrew and his sister, hand in hand, kissed one another, and he told her she was still the same crybaby as ever.
