<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;You just wait a moment, my dear fellow, and listen,&rdquo; interrupted the staff captain in his deep bass, calmly stroking his long mustache. &ldquo;You tell the colonel in the presence of other officers that an officer has stolen...&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not to blame that the conversation began in the presence of other officers. Perhaps I ought not to have spoken before them, but I am not a diplomatist. That&rsquo;s why I joined the hussars, thinking that here one would not need finesse; and he tells me that I am lying&mdash;so let him give me satisfaction...&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right. No one thinks you a coward, but that&rsquo;s not the point. Ask Den√≠sov whether it is not out of the question for a cadet to demand satisfaction of his regimental commander?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
