<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> And now, when one wants to smooth the thing over, some conceit prevents your apologizing, and you wish to make the whole affair public. You are offended at being put on duty a bit, but why not apologize to an old and honorable officer? Whatever Bogdánich may be, anyway he is an honorable and brave old colonel!

Am I not right, Denísov? It&rsquo;s not the same!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
