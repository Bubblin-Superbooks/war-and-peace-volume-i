<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> If a man lacking in self-confidence remains dumb on a first introduction and betrays a consciousness of the impropriety of such silence and an anxiety to find something to say, the effect is bad. But Anatole was dumb, swung his foot, and smilingly examined the princess&rsquo; hair. It was evident that he could be silent in this way for a very long time. &ldquo;If anyone finds this silence inconvenient, let him talk, but I don&rsquo;t want to,&rdquo; he seemed to say. Besides this, in his behavior to women Anatole had a manner which particularly inspires in them curiosity, awe, and even love&mdash;a supercilious consciousness of his own superiority. It was as if he said to them: &ldquo;I know you, I know you, but why should I bother about you? You&rsquo;d be only too glad, of course.</p></div> </div>
