<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Yes: ideas of robbery, murder, and regicide,&rdquo; again interjected an ironical voice.</p><p>&ldquo;Those were extremes, no doubt, but they are not what is most important. What is important are the rights of man, emancipation from prejudices, and equality of citizenship, and all these ideas Napoleon has retained in full force.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Liberty and equality,&rdquo; said the vicomte contemptuously, as if at last deciding seriously to prove to this youth how foolish his words were, &ldquo;high-sounding words which have long been discredited. Who does not love liberty and equality? Even our Saviour preached liberty and equality. Have people since the Revolution become happier? On the contrary. We wanted liberty, but Buonaparte has destroyed it.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
