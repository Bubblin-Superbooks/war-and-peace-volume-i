<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>At Bald Hills, Prince Nicholas Andréevich Bolkónski&rsquo;s estate, the arrival of young Prince Andrew and his wife was daily expected, but this expectation did not upset the regular routine of life in the old prince&rsquo;s household. General in Chief Prince Nicholas Andréevich (nicknamed in society, &ldquo;the King of Prussia&rdquo;) ever since the Emperor Paul had exiled him to his country estate had lived there continuously with his daughter, Princess Mary, and her companion, Mademoiselle Bourienne. Though in the new reign he was free to return to the capitals, he still continued to live in the country, remarking that anyone who wanted to see him could come the hundred miles from Moscow to Bald Hills, while he himself needed no one and nothing. He used to say that there are only two sources of human vice&mdash;idleness and superstition, and only two virtues&mdash;activity and intelligence.</p></div> </div>
