Princess Mary well knew this painstaking expression of her father&rsquo;s. His face wore that expression when his dry hands clenched with vexation at her not understanding a sum in arithmetic, when rising from his chair he would walk away from her, repeating in a low voice the same words several times over.</p><p>He came to the point at once, treating her ceremoniously.</p><p>&ldquo;I have had a proposition made me concerning you,&rdquo; he said with an unnatural smile. &ldquo;I expect you have guessed that Prince Vasíli has not come and brought his pupil with him&rdquo; (for some reason Prince Bolkónski referred to Anatole as a &ldquo;pupil&rdquo;) &ldquo;for the sake of my beautiful eyes. Last night a proposition was made me on your account and, as you know my principles, I refer it to you.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
