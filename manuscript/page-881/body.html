<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>When Princess Mary came down, Prince Vasíli and his son were already in the drawing room, talking to the little princess and Mademoiselle Bourienne. When she entered with her heavy step, treading on her heels, the gentlemen and Mademoiselle Bourienne rose and the little princess, indicating her to the gentlemen, said: &ldquo;Voilà Marie!&rdquo; Princess Mary saw them all and saw them in detail. She saw Prince Vasíli&rsquo;s face, serious for an instant at the sight of her, but immediately smiling again, and the little princess curiously noting the impression &ldquo;Marie&rdquo; produced on the visitors. And she saw Mademoiselle Bourienne, with her ribbon and pretty face, and her unusually animated look which was fixed on him, but him she could not see, she only saw something large, brilliant, and handsome moving toward her as she entered the room.</p></div> </div>
