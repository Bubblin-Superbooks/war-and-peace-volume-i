I expect he has forgotten me. He paid me attentions in those days,&rdquo; said the countess, with a smile.</p><p>&ldquo;He is just the same as ever,&rdquo; replied Anna Mikháylovna, &ldquo;overflowing with amiability. His position has not turned his head at all. He said to me, &lsquo;I am sorry I can do so little for you, dear Princess. I am at your command.&rsquo; Yes, he is a fine fellow and a very kind relation. But, Nataly, you know my love for my son: I would do anything for his happiness! And my affairs are in such a bad way that my position is now a terrible one,&rdquo; continued Anna Mikháylovna, sadly, dropping her voice. &ldquo;My wretched lawsuit takes all I have and makes no progress.</p></div> </div>
