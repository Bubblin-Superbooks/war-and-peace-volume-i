<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The short, round-shouldered Captain Túshin, stumbling over the tail of the gun carriage, moved forward and, not noticing the general, looked out shading his eyes with his small hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Lift it two lines more and it will be just right,&rdquo; cried he in a feeble voice to which he tried to impart a dashing note, ill-suited to his weak figure. &ldquo;Number Two!&rdquo; he squeaked. &ldquo;Fire, Medvédev!&rdquo;</p><p>Bagratión called to him, and Túshin, raising three fingers to his cap with a bashful and awkward gesture not at all like a military salute but like a priest&rsquo;s benediction, approached the general. Though Túshin&rsquo;s guns had been intended to cannonade the valley, he was firing incendiary balls at the village of Schön Grabern visible just opposite, in front of which large masses of French were advancing.</p></div> </div>
