Denísov celebrated his promotion to the rank of major, and Rostóv, who had already drunk enough, at the end of the feast proposed the Emperor&rsquo;s health. &ldquo;Not &lsquo;our Sovereign, the Emperor,&rsquo; as they say at official dinners,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but the health of our Sovereign, that good, enchanting, and great man! Let us drink to his health and to the certain defeat of the French!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If we fought before,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;not letting the French pass, as at Schön Grabern, what shall we not do now when he is at the front? We will all die for him gladly! Is it not so, gentlemen? Perhaps I am not saying it right, I have drunk a good deal&mdash;but that is how I feel, and so do you too! To the health of Alexander the First! Hurrah!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
