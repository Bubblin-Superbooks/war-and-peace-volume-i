    <h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well, Prince, so Genoa and Lucca are now just family estates of the Buonapartes. But I warn you, if you don&amp;rsquo;t tell me that this means war, if you still try to defend the infamies and horrors perpetrated by that Antichrist&amp;mdash;I really believe he is Antichrist&amp;mdash;I will have nothing more to do with you and you are no longer my friend, no longer my &amp;lsquo;faithful slave,&amp;rsquo; as you call yourself! But how do you do? I see I have frightened you&amp;mdash;sit down and tell me all the news.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>It was in July, 1805, and the speaker was the well-known Anna Pávlovna Schérer, maid of honor and favorite of the Empress Márya Fëdorovna. With these words she greeted Prince Vasíli Kurágin, a man of high rank and importance, who was the first to arrive at her reception. Anna Pávlovna had had a cough for some days. She was, as she said, suffering from <i>la grippe; grippe</i> being then a new word in St. Petersburg, used only by the elite.</p>
    <p>All her invitations without exception, written in French, and delivered by a scarlet-liveried footman that morning, ran as follows:</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;If you have nothing better to do, Count (or Prince), and if the prospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid is not too terrible, I shall be very charmed to see you tonight between 7 and 10&amp;mdash;Annette Schérer.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Heavens! what a virulent attack!&amp;rdquo; replied the prince, not in the least disconcerted by this reception. He had just entered, wearing an embroidered court uniform, knee breeches, and shoes, and had stars on his breast and a serene expression on his flat face. He spoke in that refined French in which our grandfathers not only spoke but thought, and with the gentle, patronizing intonation natural to a man of importance who had grown old in society and at court. He went up to Anna Pávlovna, kissed her hand, presenting to her his bald, scented, and shining head, and complacently seated himself on the sofa.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;First of all, dear friend, tell me how you are. Set your friend&amp;rsquo;s mind at rest,&amp;rdquo; said he without altering his tone, beneath the politeness and affected sympathy of which indifference and even irony could be discerned.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Can one be well while suffering morally? Can one be calm in times like these if one has any feeling?&amp;rdquo; said Anna Pávlovna. &amp;ldquo;You are staying the whole evening, I hope?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;And the fete at the English ambassador&amp;rsquo;s? Today is Wednesday. I must put in an appearance there,&amp;rdquo; said the prince. &amp;ldquo;My daughter is coming for me to take me there.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I thought today&amp;rsquo;s fete had been canceled. I confess all these festivities and fireworks are becoming wearisome.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;If they had known that you wished it, the entertainment would have been put off,&amp;rdquo; said the prince, who, like a wound-up clock, by force of habit said things he did not even wish to be believed.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t tease! Well, and what has been decided about Novosíltsev&amp;rsquo;s dispatch? You know everything.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;What can one say about it?&amp;rdquo; replied the prince in a cold, listless tone. &amp;ldquo;What has been decided? They have decided that Buonaparte has burnt his boats, and I believe that we are ready to burn ours.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Prince Vasíli always spoke languidly, like an actor repeating a stale part. Anna Pávlovna Schérer on the contrary, despite her forty years, overflowed with animation and impulsiveness. To be an enthusiast had become her social vocation and, sometimes even when she did not feel like it, she became enthusiastic in order not to disappoint the expectations of those who knew her. The subdued smile which, though it did not suit her faded features, always played round her lips expressed, as in a spoiled child, a continual consciousness of her charming defect, which she neither wished, nor could, nor considered it necessary, to correct.</p>
    <p>In the midst of a conversation on political matters Anna Pávlovna burst out:</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Oh, don&amp;rsquo;t speak to me of Austria. Perhaps I don&amp;rsquo;t understand things, but Austria never has wished, and does not wish, for war. She is betraying us! Russia alone must save Europe. Our gracious sovereign recognizes his high vocation and will be true to it. That is the one thing I have faith in! Our good and wonderful sovereign has to perform the noblest role on earth, and he is so virtuous and noble that God will not forsake him. He will fulfill his vocation and crush the hydra of revolution, which has become more terrible than ever in the person of this murderer and villain! We alone must avenge the blood of the just one.... Whom, I ask you, can we rely on?... England with her commercial spirit will not and cannot understand the Emperor Alexander&amp;rsquo;s loftiness of soul. She has refused to evacuate Malta. She wanted to find, and still seeks, some secret motive in our actions. What answer did Novosíltsev get? None. The English have not understood and cannot understand the self-abnegation of our Emperor who wants nothing for himself, but only desires the good of mankind. And what have they promised? Nothing! And what little they have promised they will not perform! Prussia has always declared that Buonaparte is invincible, and that all Europe is powerless before him.... And I don&amp;rsquo;t believe a word that Hardenburg says, or Haugwitz either. This famous Prussian neutrality is just a trap. I have faith only in God and the lofty destiny of our adored monarch. He will save Europe!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>She suddenly paused, smiling at her own impetuosity.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I think,&amp;rdquo; said the prince with a smile, &amp;ldquo;that if you had been sent instead of our dear Wintzingerode you would have captured the King of Prussia&amp;rsquo;s consent by assault. You are so eloquent. Will you give me a cup of tea?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;In a moment. <i>À propos</i>,&amp;rdquo; she added, becoming calm again, &amp;ldquo;I am expecting two very interesting men tonight, le Vicomte de Mortemart, who is connected with the Montmorencys through the Rohans, one of the best French families. He is one of the genuine <i>émigrés</i>, the good ones. And also the Abbé Morio. Do you know that profound thinker? He has been received by the Emperor. Had you heard?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I shall be delighted to meet them,&amp;rdquo; said the prince. &amp;ldquo;But tell me,&amp;rdquo; he added with studied carelessness as if it had only just occurred to him, though the question he was about to ask was the chief motive of his visit, &amp;ldquo;is it true that the Dowager Empress wants Baron Funke to be appointed first secretary at Vienna? The baron by all accounts is a poor creature.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Prince Vasíli wished to obtain this post for his son, but others were trying through the Dowager Empress Márya Fëdorovna to secure it for the baron.</p>
    <p>Anna Pávlovna almost closed her eyes to indicate that neither she nor anyone else had a right to criticize what the Empress desired or was pleased with.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Baron Funke has been recommended to the Dowager Empress by her sister,&amp;rdquo; was all she said, in a dry and mournful tone.</p>
    <p>As she named the Empress, Anna Pávlovna&amp;rsquo;s face suddenly assumed an expression of profound and sincere devotion and respect mingled with sadness, and this occurred every time she mentioned her illustrious patroness. She added that Her Majesty had deigned to show Baron Funke <i>beaucoup d&amp;rsquo;estime</i>, and again her face clouded over with sadness.</p>
    <p>The prince was silent and looked indifferent. But, with the womanly and courtierlike quickness and tact habitual to her, Anna Pávlovna wished both to rebuke him (for daring to speak as he had done of a man recommended to the Empress) and at the same time to console him, so she said:</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Now about your family. Do you know that since your daughter came out everyone has been enraptured by her? They say she is amazingly beautiful.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The prince bowed to signify his respect and gratitude.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I often think,&amp;rdquo; she continued after a short pause, drawing nearer to the prince and smiling amiably at him as if to show that political and social topics were ended and the time had come for intimate conversation&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;I often think how unfairly sometimes the joys of life are distributed. Why has fate given you two such splendid children? I don&amp;rsquo;t speak of Anatole, your youngest. I don&amp;rsquo;t like him,&amp;rdquo; she added in a tone admitting of no rejoinder and raising her eyebrows. &amp;ldquo;Two such charming children. And really you appreciate them less than anyone, and so you don&amp;rsquo;t deserve to have them.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>And she smiled her ecstatic smile.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I can&amp;rsquo;t help it,&amp;rdquo; said the prince. &amp;ldquo;Lavater would have said I lack the bump of paternity.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t joke; I mean to have a serious talk with you. Do you know I am dissatisfied with your younger son? Between ourselves&amp;rdquo; (and her face assumed its melancholy expression), &amp;ldquo;he was mentioned at Her Majesty&amp;rsquo;s and you were pitied....&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The prince answered nothing, but she looked at him significantly, awaiting a reply. He frowned.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;What would you have me do?&amp;rdquo; he said at last. &amp;ldquo;You know I did all a father could for their education, and they have both turned out fools. Hippolyte is at least a quiet fool, but Anatole is an active one. That is the only difference between them.&amp;rdquo; He said this smiling in a way more natural and animated than usual, so that the wrinkles round his mouth very clearly revealed something unexpectedly coarse and unpleasant.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;And why are children born to such men as you? If you were not a father there would be nothing I could reproach you with,&amp;rdquo; said Anna Pávlovna, looking up pensively.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I am your faithful slave and to you alone I can confess that my children are the bane of my life. It is the cross I have to bear. That is how I explain it to myself. It can&amp;rsquo;t be helped!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>He said no more, but expressed his resignation to cruel fate by a gesture. Anna Pávlovna meditated.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Have you never thought of marrying your prodigal son Anatole?&amp;rdquo; she asked. &amp;ldquo;They say old maids have a mania for matchmaking, and though I don&amp;rsquo;t feel that weakness in myself as yet, I know a little person who is very unhappy with her father. She is a relation of yours, Princess Mary Bolkónskaya.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Prince Vasíli did not reply, though, with the quickness of memory and perception befitting a man of the world, he indicated by a movement of the head that he was considering this information.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Do you know,&amp;rdquo; he said at last, evidently unable to check the sad current of his thoughts, &amp;ldquo;that Anatole is costing me forty thousand rubles a year? And,&amp;rdquo; he went on after a pause, &amp;ldquo;what will it be in five years, if he goes on like this?&amp;rdquo; Presently he added: &amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s what we fathers have to put up with.... Is this princess of yours rich?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Her father is very rich and stingy. He lives in the country. He is the well-known Prince Bolkónski who had to retire from the army under the late Emperor, and was nicknamed &amp;lsquo;the King of Prussia.&amp;rsquo; He is very clever but eccentric, and a bore. The poor girl is very unhappy. She has a brother; I think you know him, he married Lise Meinen lately. He is an aide-de-camp of Kutúzov&amp;rsquo;s and will be here tonight.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Listen, dear Annette,&amp;rdquo; said the prince, suddenly taking Anna Pávlovna&amp;rsquo;s hand and for some reason drawing it downwards. &amp;ldquo;Arrange that affair for me and I shall always be your most devoted slave-<i>slafe</i> with an <i>f</i>, as a village elder of mine writes in his reports. She is rich and of good family and that&amp;rsquo;s all I want.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>And with the familiarity and easy grace peculiar to him, he raised the maid of honor&amp;rsquo;s hand to his lips, kissed it, and swung it to and fro as he lay back in his armchair, looking in another direction.</p>
    <p><i>&amp;ldquo;Attendez,&amp;rdquo;</i> said Anna Pávlovna, reflecting, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll speak to Lise, young Bolkónski&amp;rsquo;s wife, this very evening, and perhaps the thing can be arranged. It shall be on your family&amp;rsquo;s behalf that I&amp;rsquo;ll start my apprenticeship as old maid.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
    <p>Anna Pávlovna&amp;rsquo;s drawing room was gradually filling. The highest Petersburg society was assembled there: people differing widely in age and character but alike in the social circle to which they belonged. Prince Vasíli&amp;rsquo;s daughter, the beautiful Hélène, came to take her father to the ambassador&amp;rsquo;s entertainment; she wore a ball dress and her badge as maid of honor. The youthful little Princess Bolkónskaya, known as <i>la femme la plus séduisante de Pétersbourg</i>, * was also there. She had been married during the previous winter, and being pregnant did not go to any large gatherings, but only to small receptions. Prince Vasíli&amp;rsquo;s son, Hippolyte, had come with Mortemart, whom he introduced. The Abbé Morio and many others had also come.</p>
    <pre class="testable">* The most fascinating woman in Petersburg.</pre>
    <p>To each new arrival Anna Pávlovna said, &amp;ldquo;You have not yet seen my aunt,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;You do not know my aunt?&amp;rdquo; and very gravely conducted him or her to a little old lady, wearing large bows of ribbon in her cap, who had come sailing in from another room as soon as the guests began to arrive; and slowly turning her eyes from the visitor to her aunt, Anna Pávlovna mentioned each one&amp;rsquo;s name and then left them.</p>
    <p>Each visitor performed the ceremony of greeting this old aunt whom not one of them knew, not one of them wanted to know, and not one of them cared about; Anna Pávlovna observed these greetings with mournful and solemn interest and silent approval. The aunt spoke to each of them in the same words, about their health and her own, and the health of Her Majesty, &amp;ldquo;who, thank God, was better today.&amp;rdquo; And each visitor, though politeness prevented his showing impatience, left the old woman with a sense of relief at having performed a vexatious duty and did not return to her the whole evening.</p>
    <p>The young Princess Bolkónskaya had brought some work in a gold-embroidered velvet bag. Her pretty little upper lip, on which a delicate dark down was just perceptible, was too short for her teeth, but it lifted all the more sweetly, and was especially charming when she occasionally drew it down to meet the lower lip. As is always the case with a thoroughly attractive woman, her defect&amp;mdash;the shortness of her upper lip and her half-open mouth&amp;mdash;seemed to be her own special and peculiar form of beauty. Everyone brightened at the sight of this pretty young woman, so soon to become a mother, so full of life and health, and carrying her burden so lightly. Old men and dull dispirited young ones who looked at her, after being in her company and talking to her a little while, felt as if they too were becoming, like her, full of life and health. All who talked to her, and at each word saw her bright smile and the constant gleam of her white teeth, thought that they were in a specially amiable mood that day.</p>
    <p>The little princess went round the table with quick, short, swaying steps, her workbag on her arm, and gaily spreading out her dress sat down on a sofa near the silver samovar, as if all she was doing was a pleasure to herself and to all around her. &amp;ldquo;I have brought my work,&amp;rdquo; said she in French, displaying her bag and addressing all present. &amp;ldquo;Mind, Annette, I hope you have not played a wicked trick on me,&amp;rdquo; she added, turning to her hostess. &amp;ldquo;You wrote that it was to be quite a small reception, and just see how badly I am dressed.&amp;rdquo; And she spread out her arms to show her short-waisted, lace-trimmed, dainty gray dress, girdled with a broad ribbon just below the breast.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;<i>Soyez tranquille, Lise</i>, you will always be prettier than anyone else,&amp;rdquo; replied Anna Pávlovna.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;You know,&amp;rdquo; said the princess in the same tone of voice and still in French, turning to a general, &amp;ldquo;my husband is deserting me? He is going to get himself killed. Tell me what this wretched war is for?&amp;rdquo; she added, addressing Prince Vasíli, and without waiting for an answer she turned to speak to his daughter, the beautiful Hélène.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;What a delightful woman this little princess is!&amp;rdquo; said Prince Vasíli to Anna Pávlovna.</p>
    <p>One of the next arrivals was a stout, heavily built young man with close-cropped hair, spectacles, the light-colored breeches fashionable at that time, a very high ruffle, and a brown dress coat. This stout young man was an illegitimate son of Count Bezúkhov, a well-known grandee of Catherine&amp;rsquo;s time who now lay dying in Moscow. The young man had not yet entered either the military or civil service, as he had only just returned from abroad where he had been educated, and this was his first appearance in society. Anna Pávlovna greeted him with the nod she accorded to the lowest hierarchy in her drawing room. But in spite of this lowest-grade greeting, a look of anxiety and fear, as at the sight of something too large and unsuited to the place, came over her face when she saw Pierre enter. Though he was certainly rather bigger than the other men in the room, her anxiety could only have reference to the clever though shy, but observant and natural, expression which distinguished him from everyone else in that drawing room.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;It is very good of you, Monsieur Pierre, to come and visit a poor invalid,&amp;rdquo; said Anna Pávlovna, exchanging an alarmed glance with her aunt as she conducted him to her.</p>
    <p>Pierre murmured something unintelligible, and continued to look round as if in search of something. On his way to the aunt he bowed to the little princess with a pleased smile, as to an intimate acquaintance.</p>
    <p>Anna Pávlovna&amp;rsquo;s alarm was justified, for Pierre turned away from the aunt without waiting to hear her speech about Her Majesty&amp;rsquo;s health. Anna Pávlovna in dismay detained him with the words: &amp;ldquo;Do you know the Abbé Morio? He is a most interesting man.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Yes, I have heard of his scheme for perpetual peace, and it is very interesting but hardly feasible.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;You think so?&amp;rdquo; rejoined Anna Pávlovna in order to say something and get away to attend to her duties as hostess. But Pierre now committed a reverse act of impoliteness. First he had left a lady before she had finished speaking to him, and now he continued to speak to another who wished to get away. With his head bent, and his big feet spread apart, he began explaining his reasons for thinking the abbé&amp;rsquo;s plan chimerical.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;We will talk of it later,&amp;rdquo; said Anna Pávlovna with a smile.</p>
    <p>And having got rid of this young man who did not know how to behave, she resumed her duties as hostess and continued to listen and watch, ready to help at any point where the conversation might happen to flag. As the foreman of a spinning mill, when he has set the hands to work, goes round and notices here a spindle that has stopped or there one that creaks or makes more noise than it should, and hastens to check the machine or set it in proper motion, so Anna Pávlovna moved about her drawing room, approaching now a silent, now a too-noisy group, and by a word or slight rearrangement kept the conversational machine in steady, proper, and regular motion. But amid these cares her anxiety about Pierre was evident. She kept an anxious watch on him when he approached the group round Mortemart to listen to what was being said there, and again when he passed to another group whose center was the abbé.</p>
    <p>Pierre had been educated abroad, and this reception at Anna Pávlovna&amp;rsquo;s was the first he had attended in Russia. He knew that all the intellectual lights of Petersburg were gathered there and, like a child in a toyshop, did not know which way to look, afraid of missing any clever conversation that was to be heard. Seeing the self-confident and refined expression on the faces of those present he was always expecting to hear something very profound. At last he came up to Morio. Here the conversation seemed interesting and he stood waiting for an opportunity to express his own views, as young people are fond of doing.</p>
    <h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
    <p>Anna Pávlovna&amp;rsquo;s reception was in full swing. The spindles hummed steadily and ceaselessly on all sides. With the exception of the aunt, beside whom sat only one elderly lady, who with her thin careworn face was rather out of place in this brilliant society, the whole company had settled into three groups. One, chiefly masculine, had formed round the abbé. Another, of young people, was grouped round the beautiful Princess Hélène, Prince Vasíli&amp;rsquo;s daughter, and the little Princess Bolkónskaya, very pretty and rosy, though rather too plump for her age. The third group was gathered round Mortemart and Anna Pávlovna.</p>
    <p>The vicomte was a nice-looking young man with soft features and polished manners, who evidently considered himself a celebrity but out of politeness modestly placed himself at the disposal of the circle in which he found himself. Anna Pávlovna was obviously serving him up as a treat to her guests. As a clever maître d&amp;rsquo;hôtel serves up as a specially choice delicacy a piece of meat that no one who had seen it in the kitchen would have cared to eat, so Anna Pávlovna served up to her guests, first the vicomte and then the abbé, as peculiarly choice morsels. The group about Mortemart immediately began discussing the murder of the Duc d&amp;rsquo;Enghien. The vicomte said that the Duc d&amp;rsquo;Enghien had perished by his own magnanimity, and that there were particular reasons for Buonaparte&amp;rsquo;s hatred of him.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Ah, yes! Do tell us all about it, Vicomte,&amp;rdquo; said Anna Pávlovna, with a pleasant feeling that there was something <i>à la Louis XV</i> in the sound of that sentence: <i>&amp;ldquo;Contez nous çela, Vicomte.&amp;rdquo;</i></p>
    <p>The vicomte bowed and smiled courteously in token of his willingness to comply. Anna Pávlovna arranged a group round him, inviting everyone to listen to his tale.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;The vicomte knew the duc personally,&amp;rdquo; whispered Anna Pávlovna to one of the guests. &amp;ldquo;The vicomte is a wonderful raconteur,&amp;rdquo; said she to another. &amp;ldquo;How evidently he belongs to the best society,&amp;rdquo; said she to a third; and the vicomte was served up to the company in the choicest and most advantageous style, like a well-garnished joint of roast beef on a hot dish.</p>
    <p>The vicomte wished to begin his story and gave a subtle smile.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Come over here, Hélène, dear,&amp;rdquo; said Anna Pávlovna to the beautiful young princess who was sitting some way off, the center of another group.</p>
    <p>The princess smiled. She rose with the same unchanging smile with which she had first entered the room&amp;mdash;the smile of a perfectly beautiful woman. With a slight rustle of her white dress trimmed with moss and ivy, with a gleam of white shoulders, glossy hair, and sparkling diamonds, she passed between the men who made way for her, not looking at any of them but smiling on all, as if graciously allowing each the privilege of admiring her beautiful figure and shapely shoulders, back, and bosom&amp;mdash;which in the fashion of those days were very much exposed&amp;mdash;and she seemed to bring the glamour of a ballroom with her as she moved toward Anna Pávlovna. Hélène was so lovely that not only did she not show any trace of coquetry, but on the contrary she even appeared shy of her unquestionable and all too victorious beauty. She seemed to wish, but to be unable, to diminish its effect.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;How lovely!&amp;rdquo; said everyone who saw her; and the vicomte lifted his shoulders and dropped his eyes as if startled by something extraordinary when she took her seat opposite and beamed upon him also with her unchanging smile.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Madame, I doubt my ability before such an audience,&amp;rdquo; said he, smilingly inclining his head.</p>
    <p>The princess rested her bare round arm on a little table and considered a reply unnecessary. She smilingly waited. All the time the story was being told she sat upright, glancing now at her beautiful round arm, altered in shape by its pressure on the table, now at her still more beautiful bosom, on which she readjusted a diamond necklace. From time to time she smoothed the folds of her dress, and whenever the story produced an effect she glanced at Anna Pávlovna, at once adopted just the expression she saw on the maid of honor&amp;rsquo;s face, and again relapsed into her radiant smile.</p>
    <p>The little princess had also left the tea table and followed Hélène.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Wait a moment, I&amp;rsquo;ll get my work.... Now then, what are you thinking of?&amp;rdquo; she went on, turning to Prince Hippolyte. &amp;ldquo;Fetch me my workbag.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>There was a general movement as the princess, smiling and talking merrily to everyone at once, sat down and gaily arranged herself in her seat.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Now I am all right,&amp;rdquo; she said, and asking the vicomte to begin, she took up her work.</p>
    <p>Prince Hippolyte, having brought the workbag, joined the circle and moving a chair close to hers seated himself beside her.</p>
    <p><i>Le charmant Hippolyte</i> was surprising by his extraordinary resemblance to his beautiful sister, but yet more by the fact that in spite of this resemblance he was exceedingly ugly. His features were like his sister&amp;rsquo;s, but while in her case everything was lit up by a joyous, self-satisfied, youthful, and constant smile of animation, and by the wonderful classic beauty of her figure, his face on the contrary was dulled by imbecility and a constant expression of sullen self-confidence, while his body was thin and weak. His eyes, nose, and mouth all seemed puckered into a vacant, wearied grimace, and his arms and legs always fell into unnatural positions.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s not going to be a ghost story?&amp;rdquo; said he, sitting down beside the princess and hastily adjusting his lorgnette, as if without this instrument he could not begin to speak.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Why no, my dear fellow,&amp;rdquo; said the astonished narrator, shrugging his shoulders.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Because I hate ghost stories,&amp;rdquo; said Prince Hippolyte in a tone which showed that he only understood the meaning of his words after he had uttered them.</p>
    <p>He spoke with such self-confidence that his hearers could not be sure whether what he said was very witty or very stupid. He was dressed in a dark-green dress coat, knee breeches of the color of <i>cuisse de nymphe effrayée</i>, as he called it, shoes, and silk stockings.</p>
    <p>The vicomte told his tale very neatly. It was an anecdote, then current, to the effect that the Duc d&amp;rsquo;Enghien had gone secretly to Paris to visit Mademoiselle George; that at her house he came upon Bonaparte, who also enjoyed the famous actress&amp;rsquo; favors, and that in his presence Napoleon happened to fall into one of the fainting fits to which he was subject, and was thus at the duc&amp;rsquo;s mercy. The latter spared him, and this magnanimity Bonaparte subsequently repaid by death.</p>
    <p>The story was very pretty and interesting, especially at the point where the rivals suddenly recognized one another; and the ladies looked agitated.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Charming!&amp;rdquo; said Anna Pávlovna with an inquiring glance at the little princess.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Charming!&amp;rdquo; whispered the little princess, sticking the needle into her work as if to testify that the interest and fascination of the story prevented her from going on with it.</p>
    <p>The vicomte appreciated this silent praise and smiling gratefully prepared to continue, but just then Anna Pávlovna, who had kept a watchful eye on the young man who so alarmed her, noticed that he was talking too loudly and vehemently with the abbé, so she hurried to the rescue. Pierre had managed to start a conversation with the abbé about the balance of power, and the latter, evidently interested by the young man&amp;rsquo;s simple-minded eagerness, was explaining his pet theory. Both were talking and listening too eagerly and too naturally, which was why Anna Pávlovna disapproved.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;The means are ... the balance of power in Europe and the rights of the people,&amp;rdquo; the abbé was saying. &amp;ldquo;It is only necessary for one powerful nation like Russia&amp;mdash;barbaric as she is said to be&amp;mdash;to place herself disinterestedly at the head of an alliance having for its object the maintenance of the balance of power of Europe, and it would save the world!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;But how are you to get that balance?&amp;rdquo; Pierre was beginning.</p>
    <p>At that moment Anna Pávlovna came up and, looking severely at Pierre, asked the Italian how he stood Russian climate. The Italian&amp;rsquo;s face instantly changed and assumed an offensively affected, sugary expression, evidently habitual to him when conversing with women.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I am so enchanted by the brilliancy of the wit and culture of the society, more especially of the feminine society, in which I have had the honor of being received, that I have not yet had time to think of the climate,&amp;rdquo; said he.</p>
    <p>Not letting the abbé and Pierre escape, Anna Pávlovna, the more conveniently to keep them under observation, brought them into the larger circle.</p>
    <h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
    <p>Just then another visitor entered the drawing room: Prince Andrew Bolkónski, the little princess&amp;rsquo; husband. He was a very handsome young man, of medium height, with firm, clearcut features. Everything about him, from his weary, bored expression to his quiet, measured step, offered a most striking contrast to his quiet, little wife. It was evident that he not only knew everyone in the drawing room, but had found them to be so tiresome that it wearied him to look at or listen to them. And among all these faces that he found so tedious, none seemed to bore him so much as that of his pretty wife. He turned away from her with a grimace that distorted his handsome face, kissed Anna Pávlovna&amp;rsquo;s hand, and screwing up his eyes scanned the whole company.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;You are off to the war, Prince?&amp;rdquo; said Anna Pávlovna.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;General Kutúzov,&amp;rdquo; said Bolkónski, speaking French and stressing the last syllable of the general&amp;rsquo;s name like a Frenchman, &amp;ldquo;has been pleased to take me as an aide-de-camp....&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;And Lise, your wife?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;She will go to the country.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Are you not ashamed to deprive us of your charming wife?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p><i>&amp;ldquo;André,&amp;rdquo;</i> said his wife, addressing her husband in the same coquettish manner in which she spoke to other men, &amp;ldquo;the vicomte has been telling us such a tale about Mademoiselle George and Buonaparte!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Prince Andrew screwed up his eyes and turned away. Pierre, who from the moment Prince Andrew entered the room had watched him with glad, affectionate eyes, now came up and took his arm. Before he looked round Prince Andrew frowned again, expressing his annoyance with whoever was touching his arm, but when he saw Pierre&amp;rsquo;s beaming face he gave him an unexpectedly kind and pleasant smile.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;There now!... So you, too, are in the great world?&amp;rdquo; said he to Pierre.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I knew you would be here,&amp;rdquo; replied Pierre. &amp;ldquo;I will come to supper with you. May I?&amp;rdquo; he added in a low voice so as not to disturb the vicomte who was continuing his story.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;No, impossible!&amp;rdquo; said Prince Andrew, laughing and pressing Pierre&amp;rsquo;s hand to show that there was no need to ask the question. He wished to say something more, but at that moment Prince Vasíli and his daughter got up to go and the two young men rose to let them pass.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;You must excuse me, dear Vicomte,&amp;rdquo; said Prince Vasíli to the Frenchman, holding him down by the sleeve in a friendly way to prevent his rising. &amp;ldquo;This unfortunate fete at the ambassador&amp;rsquo;s deprives me of a pleasure, and obliges me to interrupt you. I am very sorry to leave your enchanting party,&amp;rdquo; said he, turning to Anna Pávlovna.</p>
    <p>His daughter, Princess Hélène, passed between the chairs, lightly holding up the folds of her dress, and the smile shone still more radiantly on her beautiful face. Pierre gazed at her with rapturous, almost frightened, eyes as she passed him.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Very lovely,&amp;rdquo; said Prince Andrew.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Very,&amp;rdquo; said Pierre.</p>
    <p>In passing Prince Vasíli seized Pierre&amp;rsquo;s hand and said to Anna Pávlovna: &amp;ldquo;Educate this bear for me! He has been staying with me a whole month and this is the first time I have seen him in society. Nothing is so necessary for a young man as the society of clever women.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Anna Pávlovna smiled and promised to take Pierre in hand. She knew his father to be a connection of Prince Vasíli&amp;rsquo;s. The elderly lady who had been sitting with the old aunt rose hurriedly and overtook Prince Vasíli in the anteroom. All the affectation of interest she had assumed had left her kindly and tear-worn face and it now expressed only anxiety and fear.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;How about my son Borís, Prince?&amp;rdquo; said she, hurrying after him into the anteroom. &amp;ldquo;I can&amp;rsquo;t remain any longer in Petersburg. Tell me what news I may take back to my poor boy.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Although Prince Vasíli listened reluctantly and not very politely to the elderly lady, even betraying some impatience, she gave him an ingratiating and appealing smile, and took his hand that he might not go away.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;What would it cost you to say a word to the Emperor, and then he would be transferred to the Guards at once?&amp;rdquo; said she.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Believe me, Princess, I am ready to do all I can,&amp;rdquo; answered Prince Vasíli, &amp;ldquo;but it is difficult for me to ask the Emperor. I should advise you to appeal to Rumyántsev through Prince Golítsyn. That would be the best way.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The elderly lady was a Princess Drubetskáya, belonging to one of the best families in Russia, but she was poor, and having long been out of society had lost her former influential connections. She had now come to Petersburg to procure an appointment in the Guards for her only son. It was, in fact, solely to meet Prince Vasíli that she had obtained an invitation to Anna Pávlovna&amp;rsquo;s reception and had sat listening to the vicomte&amp;rsquo;s story. Prince Vasíli&amp;rsquo;s words frightened her, an embittered look clouded her once handsome face, but only for a moment; then she smiled again and clutched Prince Vasíli&amp;rsquo;s arm more tightly.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Listen to me, Prince,&amp;rdquo; said she. &amp;ldquo;I have never yet asked you for anything and I never will again, nor have I ever reminded you of my father&amp;rsquo;s friendship for you; but now I entreat you for God&amp;rsquo;s sake to do this for my son&amp;mdash;and I shall always regard you as a benefactor,&amp;rdquo; she added hurriedly. &amp;ldquo;No, don&amp;rsquo;t be angry, but promise! I have asked Golítsyn and he has refused. Be the kindhearted man you always were,&amp;rdquo; she said, trying to smile though tears were in her eyes.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Papa, we shall be late,&amp;rdquo; said Princess Hélène, turning her beautiful head and looking over her classically molded shoulder as she stood waiting by the door.</p>
    <p>Influence in society, however, is a capital which has to be economized if it is to last. Prince Vasíli knew this, and having once realized that if he asked on behalf of all who begged of him, he would soon be unable to ask for himself, he became chary of using his influence. But in Princess Drubetskáya&amp;rsquo;s case he felt, after her second appeal, something like qualms of conscience. She had reminded him of what was quite true; he had been indebted to her father for the first steps in his career. Moreover, he could see by her manners that she was one of those women&amp;mdash;mostly mothers&amp;mdash;who, having once made up their minds, will not rest until they have gained their end, and are prepared if necessary to go on insisting day after day and hour after hour, and even to make scenes. This last consideration moved him.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;My dear Anna Mikháylovna,&amp;rdquo; said he with his usual familiarity and weariness of tone, &amp;ldquo;it is almost impossible for me to do what you ask; but to prove my devotion to you and how I respect your father&amp;rsquo;s memory, I will do the impossible&amp;mdash;your son shall be transferred to the Guards. Here is my hand on it. Are you satisfied?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;My dear benefactor! This is what I expected from you&amp;mdash;I knew your kindness!&amp;rdquo; He turned to go.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Wait&amp;mdash;just a word! When he has been transferred to the Guards...&amp;rdquo; she faltered. &amp;ldquo;You are on good terms with Michael Ilariónovich Kutúzov ... recommend Borís to him as adjutant! Then I shall be at rest, and then...&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Prince Vasíli smiled.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;No, I won&amp;rsquo;t promise that. You don&amp;rsquo;t know how Kutúzov is pestered since his appointment as Commander in Chief. He told me himself that all the Moscow ladies have conspired to give him all their sons as adjutants.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;No, but do promise! I won&amp;rsquo;t let you go! My dear benefactor...&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Papa,&amp;rdquo; said his beautiful daughter in the same tone as before, &amp;ldquo;we shall be late.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well, <i>au revoir!</i> Good-by! You hear her?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Then tomorrow you will speak to the Emperor?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Certainly; but about Kutúzov, I don&amp;rsquo;t promise.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Do promise, do promise, Vasíli!&amp;rdquo; cried Anna Mikháylovna as he went, with the smile of a coquettish girl, which at one time probably came naturally to her, but was now very ill-suited to her careworn face.</p>
    <p>Apparently she had forgotten her age and by force of habit employed all the old feminine arts. But as soon as the prince had gone her face resumed its former cold, artificial expression. She returned to the group where the vicomte was still talking, and again pretended to listen, while waiting till it would be time to leave. Her task was accomplished.</p>
    <h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;And what do you think of this latest comedy, the coronation at Milan?&amp;rdquo; asked Anna Pávlovna, &amp;ldquo;and of the comedy of the people of Genoa and Lucca laying their petitions before Monsieur Buonaparte, and Monsieur Buonaparte sitting on a throne and granting the petitions of the nations? Adorable! It is enough to make one&amp;rsquo;s head whirl! It is as if the whole world had gone crazy.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Prince Andrew looked Anna Pávlovna straight in the face with a sarcastic smile.</p>
    <p><i>&amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Dieu me la donne, gare à qui la touche!&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;</i> * They say he was very fine when he said that,&amp;rdquo; he remarked, repeating the words in Italian: <i>&amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Dio mi l&amp;rsquo;ha dato. Guai a chi la tocchi!&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;</i></p>
    <pre class="testable">* God has given it to me, let him who touches it beware!</pre>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I hope this will prove the last drop that will make the glass run over,&amp;rdquo; Anna Pávlovna continued. &amp;ldquo;The sovereigns will not be able to endure this man who is a menace to everything.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;The sovereigns? I do not speak of Russia,&amp;rdquo; said the vicomte, polite but hopeless: &amp;ldquo;The sovereigns, madame... What have they done for Louis XVII, for the Queen, or for Madame Elizabeth? Nothing!&amp;rdquo; and he became more animated. &amp;ldquo;And believe me, they are reaping the reward of their betrayal of the Bourbon cause. The sovereigns! Why, they are sending ambassadors to compliment the usurper.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>And sighing disdainfully, he again changed his position.</p>
    <p>Prince Hippolyte, who had been gazing at the vicomte for some time through his lorgnette, suddenly turned completely round toward the little princess, and having asked for a needle began tracing the Condé coat of arms on the table. He explained this to her with as much gravity as if she had asked him to do it.</p>
    <p><i>&amp;ldquo;Bâton de gueules, engrêlé de gueules d&amp;rsquo;azur&amp;mdash;maison Condé,&amp;rdquo;</i> said he.</p>
    <p>The princess listened, smiling.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;If Buonaparte remains on the throne of France a year longer,&amp;rdquo; the vicomte continued, with the air of a man who, in a matter with which he is better acquainted than anyone else, does not listen to others but follows the current of his own thoughts, &amp;ldquo;things will have gone too far. By intrigues, violence, exile, and executions, French society&amp;mdash;I mean good French society&amp;mdash;will have been forever destroyed, and then....&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>He shrugged his shoulders and spread out his hands. Pierre wished to make a remark, for the conversation interested him, but Anna Pávlovna, who had him under observation, interrupted:</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;The Emperor Alexander,&amp;rdquo; said she, with the melancholy which always accompanied any reference of hers to the Imperial family, &amp;ldquo;has declared that he will leave it to the French people themselves to choose their own form of government; and I believe that once free from the usurper, the whole nation will certainly throw itself into the arms of its rightful king,&amp;rdquo; she concluded, trying to be amiable to the royalist emigrant.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;That is doubtful,&amp;rdquo; said Prince Andrew. &amp;ldquo;Monsieur le Vicomte quite rightly supposes that matters have already gone too far. I think it will be difficult to return to the old regime.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;From what I have heard,&amp;rdquo; said Pierre, blushing and breaking into the conversation, &amp;ldquo;almost all the aristocracy has already gone over to Bonaparte&amp;rsquo;s side.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;It is the Buonapartists who say that,&amp;rdquo; replied the vicomte without looking at Pierre. &amp;ldquo;At the present time it is difficult to know the real state of French public opinion.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Bonaparte has said so,&amp;rdquo; remarked Prince Andrew with a sarcastic smile.</p>
    <p>It was evident that he did not like the vicomte and was aiming his remarks at him, though without looking at him.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;I showed them the path to glory, but they did not follow it,&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo; Prince Andrew continued after a short silence, again quoting Napoleon&amp;rsquo;s words. &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;I opened my antechambers and they crowded in.&amp;rsquo; I do not know how far he was justified in saying so.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Not in the least,&amp;rdquo; replied the vicomte. &amp;ldquo;After the murder of the duc even the most partial ceased to regard him as a hero. If to some people,&amp;rdquo; he went on, turning to Anna Pávlovna, &amp;ldquo;he ever was a hero, after the murder of the duc there was one martyr more in heaven and one hero less on earth.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Before Anna Pávlovna and the others had time to smile their appreciation of the vicomte&amp;rsquo;s epigram, Pierre again broke into the conversation, and though Anna Pávlovna felt sure he would say something inappropriate, she was unable to stop him.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;The execution of the Duc d&amp;rsquo;Enghien,&amp;rdquo; declared Monsieur Pierre, &amp;ldquo;was a political necessity, and it seems to me that Napoleon showed greatness of soul by not fearing to take on himself the whole responsibility of that deed.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p><i>&amp;ldquo;Dieu! Mon Dieu!&amp;rdquo;</i> muttered Anna Pávlovna in a terrified whisper.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;What, Monsieur Pierre... Do you consider that assassination shows greatness of soul?&amp;rdquo; said the little princess, smiling and drawing her work nearer to her.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Oh! Oh!&amp;rdquo; exclaimed several voices.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Capital!&amp;rdquo; said Prince Hippolyte in English, and began slapping his knee with the palm of his hand.</p>
    <p>The vicomte merely shrugged his shoulders. Pierre looked solemnly at his audience over his spectacles and continued.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I say so,&amp;rdquo; he continued desperately, &amp;ldquo;because the Bourbons fled from the Revolution leaving the people to anarchy, and Napoleon alone understood the Revolution and quelled it, and so for the general good, he could not stop short for the sake of one man&amp;rsquo;s life.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Won&amp;rsquo;t you come over to the other table?&amp;rdquo; suggested Anna Pávlovna.</p>
    <p>But Pierre continued his speech without heeding her.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;No,&amp;rdquo; cried he, becoming more and more eager, &amp;ldquo;Napoleon is great because he rose superior to the Revolution, suppressed its abuses, preserved all that was good in it&amp;mdash;equality of citizenship and freedom of speech and of the press&amp;mdash;and only for that reason did he obtain power.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Yes, if having obtained power, without availing himself of it to commit murder he had restored it to the rightful king, I should have called him a great man,&amp;rdquo; remarked the vicomte.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;He could not do that. The people only gave him power that he might rid them of the Bourbons and because they saw that he was a great man. The Revolution was a grand thing!&amp;rdquo; continued Monsieur Pierre, betraying by this desperate and provocative proposition his extreme youth and his wish to express all that was in his mind.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;What? Revolution and regicide a grand thing?... Well, after that... But won&amp;rsquo;t you come to this other table?&amp;rdquo; repeated Anna Pávlovna.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Rousseau&amp;rsquo;s <i>Contrat Social</i>,&amp;rdquo; said the vicomte with a tolerant smile.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I am not speaking of regicide, I am speaking about ideas.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Yes: ideas of robbery, murder, and regicide,&amp;rdquo; again interjected an ironical voice.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Those were extremes, no doubt, but they are not what is most important. What is important are the rights of man, emancipation from prejudices, and equality of citizenship, and all these ideas Napoleon has retained in full force.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Liberty and equality,&amp;rdquo; said the vicomte contemptuously, as if at last deciding seriously to prove to this youth how foolish his words were, &amp;ldquo;high-sounding words which have long been discredited. Who does not love liberty and equality? Even our Saviour preached liberty and equality. Have people since the Revolution become happier? On the contrary. We wanted liberty, but Buonaparte has destroyed it.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Prince Andrew kept looking with an amused smile from Pierre to the vicomte and from the vicomte to their hostess. In the first moment of Pierre&amp;rsquo;s outburst Anna Pávlovna, despite her social experience, was horror-struck. But when she saw that Pierre&amp;rsquo;s sacrilegious words had not exasperated the vicomte, and had convinced herself that it was impossible to stop him, she rallied her forces and joined the vicomte in a vigorous attack on the orator.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;But, my dear Monsieur Pierre,&amp;rdquo; said she, &amp;ldquo;how do you explain the fact of a great man executing a duc&amp;mdash;or even an ordinary man who&amp;mdash;is innocent and untried?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I should like,&amp;rdquo; said the vicomte, &amp;ldquo;to ask how monsieur explains the 18th Brumaire; was not that an imposture? It was a swindle, and not at all like the conduct of a great man!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;And the prisoners he killed in Africa? That was horrible!&amp;rdquo; said the little princess, shrugging her shoulders.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;He&amp;rsquo;s a low fellow, say what you will,&amp;rdquo; remarked Prince Hippolyte.</p>
    <p>Pierre, not knowing whom to answer, looked at them all and smiled. His smile was unlike the half-smile of other people. When he smiled, his grave, even rather gloomy, look was instantaneously replaced by another&amp;mdash;a childlike, kindly, even rather silly look, which seemed to ask forgiveness.</p>
    <p>The vicomte who was meeting him for the first time saw clearly that this young Jacobin was not so terrible as his words suggested. All were silent.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;How do you expect him to answer you all at once?&amp;rdquo; said Prince Andrew. &amp;ldquo;Besides, in the actions of a statesman one has to distinguish between his acts as a private person, as a general, and as an emperor. So it seems to me.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Yes, yes, of course!&amp;rdquo; Pierre chimed in, pleased at the arrival of this reinforcement.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;One must admit,&amp;rdquo; continued Prince Andrew, &amp;ldquo;that Napoleon as a man was great on the bridge of Arcola, and in the hospital at Jaffa where he gave his hand to the plague-stricken; but ... but there are other acts which it is difficult to justify.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Prince Andrew, who had evidently wished to tone down the awkwardness of Pierre&amp;rsquo;s remarks, rose and made a sign to his wife that it was time to go.</p>
    <p>Suddenly Prince Hippolyte started up making signs to everyone to attend, and asking them all to be seated began:</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I was told a charming Moscow story today and must treat you to it. Excuse me, Vicomte&amp;mdash;I must tell it in Russian or the point will be lost....&amp;rdquo; And Prince Hippolyte began to tell his story in such Russian as a Frenchman would speak after spending about a year in Russia. Everyone waited, so emphatically and eagerly did he demand their attention to his story.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;There is in Moscow a lady, <i>une dame</i>, and she is very stingy. She must have two footmen behind her carriage, and very big ones. That was her taste. And she had a lady&amp;rsquo;s maid, also big. She said....&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Here Prince Hippolyte paused, evidently collecting his ideas with difficulty.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;She said.... Oh yes! She said, &amp;lsquo;Girl,&amp;rsquo; to the maid, &amp;lsquo;put on a livery, get up behind the carriage, and come with me while I make some calls.&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Here Prince Hippolyte spluttered and burst out laughing long before his audience, which produced an effect unfavorable to the narrator. Several persons, among them the elderly lady and Anna Pávlovna, did however smile.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;She went. Suddenly there was a great wind. The girl lost her hat and her long hair came down....&amp;rdquo; Here he could contain himself no longer and went on, between gasps of laughter: &amp;ldquo;And the whole world knew....&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>And so the anecdote ended. Though it was unintelligible why he had told it, or why it had to be told in Russian, still Anna Pávlovna and the others appreciated Prince Hippolyte&amp;rsquo;s social tact in so agreeably ending Pierre&amp;rsquo;s unpleasant and unamiable outburst. After the anecdote the conversation broke up into insignificant small talk about the last and next balls, about theatricals, and who would meet whom, and when and where.</p>
    <h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
    <p>Having thanked Anna Pávlovna for her charming soiree, the guests began to take their leave.</p>
    <p>Pierre was ungainly. Stout, about the average height, broad, with huge red hands; he did not know, as the saying is, how to enter a drawing room and still less how to leave one; that is, how to say something particularly agreeable before going away. Besides this he was absent-minded. When he rose to go, he took up instead of his own, the general&amp;rsquo;s three-cornered hat, and held it, pulling at the plume, till the general asked him to restore it. All his absent-mindedness and inability to enter a room and converse in it was, however, redeemed by his kindly, simple, and modest expression. Anna Pávlovna turned toward him and, with a Christian mildness that expressed forgiveness of his indiscretion, nodded and said: &amp;ldquo;I hope to see you again, but I also hope you will change your opinions, my dear Monsieur Pierre.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>When she said this, he did not reply and only bowed, but again everybody saw his smile, which said nothing, unless perhaps, &amp;ldquo;Opinions are opinions, but you see what a capital, good-natured fellow I am.&amp;rdquo; And everyone, including Anna Pávlovna, felt this.</p>
    <p>Prince Andrew had gone out into the hall, and, turning his shoulders to the footman who was helping him on with his cloak, listened indifferently to his wife&amp;rsquo;s chatter with Prince Hippolyte who had also come into the hall. Prince Hippolyte stood close to the pretty, pregnant princess, and stared fixedly at her through his eyeglass.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Go in, Annette, or you will catch cold,&amp;rdquo; said the little princess, taking leave of Anna Pávlovna. &amp;ldquo;It is settled,&amp;rdquo; she added in a low voice.</p>
    <p>Anna Pávlovna had already managed to speak to Lise about the match she contemplated between Anatole and the little princess&amp;rsquo; sister-in-law.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I rely on you, my dear,&amp;rdquo; said Anna Pávlovna, also in a low tone. &amp;ldquo;Write to her and let me know how her father looks at the matter. <i>Au revoir!</i>&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;and she left the hall.</p>
    <p>Prince Hippolyte approached the little princess and, bending his face close to her, began to whisper something.</p>
    <p>Two footmen, the princess&amp;rsquo; and his own, stood holding a shawl and a cloak, waiting for the conversation to finish. They listened to the French sentences which to them were meaningless, with an air of understanding but not wishing to appear to do so. The princess as usual spoke smilingly and listened with a laugh.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I am very glad I did not go to the ambassador&amp;rsquo;s,&amp;rdquo; said Prince Hippolyte &amp;ldquo;&amp;mdash;so dull&amp;mdash;. It has been a delightful evening, has it not? Delightful!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;They say the ball will be very good,&amp;rdquo; replied the princess, drawing up her downy little lip. &amp;ldquo;All the pretty women in society will be there.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Not all, for you will not be there; not all,&amp;rdquo; said Prince Hippolyte smiling joyfully; and snatching the shawl from the footman, whom he even pushed aside, he began wrapping it round the princess. Either from awkwardness or intentionally (no one could have said which) after the shawl had been adjusted he kept his arm around her for a long time, as though embracing her.</p>
    <p>Still smiling, she gracefully moved away, turning and glancing at her husband. Prince Andrew&amp;rsquo;s eyes were closed, so weary and sleepy did he seem.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Are you ready?&amp;rdquo; he asked his wife, looking past her.</p>
    <p>Prince Hippolyte hurriedly put on his cloak, which in the latest fashion reached to his very heels, and, stumbling in it, ran out into the porch following the princess, whom a footman was helping into the carriage.</p>
    <p><i>&amp;ldquo;Princesse, au revoir,&amp;rdquo;</i> cried he, stumbling with his tongue as well as with his feet.</p>
    <p>The princess, picking up her dress, was taking her seat in the dark carriage, her husband was adjusting his saber; Prince Hippolyte, under pretense of helping, was in everyone&amp;rsquo;s way.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Allow me, sir,&amp;rdquo; said Prince Andrew in Russian in a cold, disagreeable tone to Prince Hippolyte who was blocking his path.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I am expecting you, Pierre,&amp;rdquo; said the same voice, but gently and affectionately.</p>
    <p>The postilion started, the carriage wheels rattled. Prince Hippolyte laughed spasmodically as he stood in the porch waiting for the vicomte whom he had promised to take home.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well, <i>mon cher</i>,&amp;rdquo; said the vicomte, having seated himself beside Hippolyte in the carriage, &amp;ldquo;your little princess is very nice, very nice indeed, quite French,&amp;rdquo; and he kissed the tips of his fingers. Hippolyte burst out laughing.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Do you know, you are a terrible chap for all your innocent airs,&amp;rdquo; continued the vicomte. &amp;ldquo;I pity the poor husband, that little officer who gives himself the airs of a monarch.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Hippolyte spluttered again, and amid his laughter said, &amp;ldquo;And you were saying that the Russian ladies are not equal to the French? One has to know how to deal with them.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Pierre reaching the house first went into Prince Andrew&amp;rsquo;s study like one quite at home, and from habit immediately lay down on the sofa, took from the shelf the first book that came to his hand (it was Caesar&amp;rsquo;s <i>Commentaries</i>), and resting on his elbow, began reading it in the middle.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;What have you done to Mlle Schérer? She will be quite ill now,&amp;rdquo; said Prince Andrew, as he entered the study, rubbing his small white hands.</p>
    <p>Pierre turned his whole body, making the sofa creak. He lifted his eager face to Prince Andrew, smiled, and waved his hand.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;That abbé is very interesting but he does not see the thing in the right light.... In my opinion perpetual peace is possible but&amp;mdash;I do not know how to express it ... not by a balance of political power....&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>It was evident that Prince Andrew was not interested in such abstract conversation.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;One can&amp;rsquo;t everywhere say all one thinks, <i>mon cher</i>. Well, have you at last decided on anything? Are you going to be a guardsman or a diplomatist?&amp;rdquo; asked Prince Andrew after a momentary silence.</p>
    <p>Pierre sat up on the sofa, with his legs tucked under him.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Really, I don&amp;rsquo;t yet know. I don&amp;rsquo;t like either the one or the other.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;But you must decide on something! Your father expects it.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Pierre at the age of ten had been sent abroad with an abbé as tutor, and had remained away till he was twenty. When he returned to Moscow his father dismissed the abbé and said to the young man, &amp;ldquo;Now go to Petersburg, look round, and choose your profession. I will agree to anything. Here is a letter to Prince Vasíli, and here is money. Write to me all about it, and I will help you in everything.&amp;rdquo; Pierre had already been choosing a career for three months, and had not decided on anything. It was about this choice that Prince Andrew was speaking. Pierre rubbed his forehead.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;But he must be a Freemason,&amp;rdquo; said he, referring to the abbé whom he had met that evening.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;That is all nonsense.&amp;rdquo; Prince Andrew again interrupted him, &amp;ldquo;let us talk business. Have you been to the Horse Guards?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;No, I have not; but this is what I have been thinking and wanted to tell you. There is a war now against Napoleon. If it were a war for freedom I could understand it and should be the first to enter the army; but to help England and Austria against the greatest man in the world is not right.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Prince Andrew only shrugged his shoulders at Pierre&amp;rsquo;s childish words. He put on the air of one who finds it impossible to reply to such nonsense, but it would in fact have been difficult to give any other answer than the one Prince Andrew gave to this naïve question.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;If no one fought except on his own conviction, there would be no wars,&amp;rdquo; he said.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;And that would be splendid,&amp;rdquo; said Pierre.</p>
    <p>Prince Andrew smiled ironically.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Very likely it would be splendid, but it will never come about....&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well, why are you going to the war?&amp;rdquo; asked Pierre.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;What for? I don&amp;rsquo;t know. I must. Besides that I am going....&amp;rdquo; He paused. &amp;ldquo;I am going because the life I am leading here does not suit me!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
    <p>The rustle of a woman&amp;rsquo;s dress was heard in the next room. Prince Andrew shook himself as if waking up, and his face assumed the look it had had in Anna Pávlovna&amp;rsquo;s drawing room. Pierre removed his feet from the sofa. The princess came in. She had changed her gown for a house dress as fresh and elegant as the other. Prince Andrew rose and politely placed a chair for her.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;How is it,&amp;rdquo; she began, as usual in French, settling down briskly and fussily in the easy chair, &amp;ldquo;how is it Annette never got married? How stupid you men all are not to have married her! Excuse me for saying so, but you have no sense about women. What an argumentative fellow you are, Monsieur Pierre!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;And I am still arguing with your husband. I can&amp;rsquo;t understand why he wants to go to the war,&amp;rdquo; replied Pierre, addressing the princess with none of the embarrassment so commonly shown by young men in their intercourse with young women.</p>
    <p>The princess started. Evidently Pierre&amp;rsquo;s words touched her to the quick.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Ah, that is just what I tell him!&amp;rdquo; said she. &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t understand it; I don&amp;rsquo;t in the least understand why men can&amp;rsquo;t live without wars. How is it that we women don&amp;rsquo;t want anything of the kind, don&amp;rsquo;t need it? Now you shall judge between us. I always tell him: Here he is Uncle&amp;rsquo;s aide-de-camp, a most brilliant position. He is so well known, so much appreciated by everyone. The other day at the Apráksins&amp;rsquo; I heard a lady asking, &amp;lsquo;Is that the famous Prince Andrew?&amp;rsquo; I did indeed.&amp;rdquo; She laughed. &amp;ldquo;He is so well received everywhere. He might easily become aide-de-camp to the Emperor. You know the Emperor spoke to him most graciously. Annette and I were speaking of how to arrange it. What do you think?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Pierre looked at his friend and, noticing that he did not like the conversation, gave no reply.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;When are you starting?&amp;rdquo; he asked.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Oh, don&amp;rsquo;t speak of his going, don&amp;rsquo;t! I won&amp;rsquo;t hear it spoken of,&amp;rdquo; said the princess in the same petulantly playful tone in which she had spoken to Hippolyte in the drawing room and which was so plainly ill-suited to the family circle of which Pierre was almost a member. &amp;ldquo;Today when I remembered that all these delightful associations must be broken off ... and then you know, André...&amp;rdquo; (she looked significantly at her husband) &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m afraid, I&amp;rsquo;m afraid!&amp;rdquo; she whispered, and a shudder ran down her back.</p>
    <p>Her husband looked at her as if surprised to notice that someone besides Pierre and himself was in the room, and addressed her in a tone of frigid politeness.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;What is it you are afraid of, Lise? I don&amp;rsquo;t understand,&amp;rdquo; said he.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;There, what egotists men all are: all, all egotists! Just for a whim of his own, goodness only knows why, he leaves me and locks me up alone in the country.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;With my father and sister, remember,&amp;rdquo; said Prince Andrew gently.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Alone all the same, without <i>my</i> friends.... And he expects me not to be afraid.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Her tone was now querulous and her lip drawn up, giving her not a joyful, but an animal, squirrel-like expression. She paused as if she felt it indecorous to speak of her pregnancy before Pierre, though the gist of the matter lay in that.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I still can&amp;rsquo;t understand what you are afraid of,&amp;rdquo; said Prince Andrew slowly, not taking his eyes off his wife.</p>
    <p>The princess blushed, and raised her arms with a gesture of despair.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;No, Andrew, I must say you have changed. Oh, how you have....&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Your doctor tells you to go to bed earlier,&amp;rdquo; said Prince Andrew. &amp;ldquo;You had better go.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The princess said nothing, but suddenly her short downy lip quivered. Prince Andrew rose, shrugged his shoulders, and walked about the room.</p>
    <p>Pierre looked over his spectacles with naïve surprise, now at him and now at her, moved as if about to rise too, but changed his mind.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Why should I mind Monsieur Pierre being here?&amp;rdquo; exclaimed the little princess suddenly, her pretty face all at once distorted by a tearful grimace. &amp;ldquo;I have long wanted to ask you, Andrew, why you have changed so to me? What have I done to you? You are going to the war and have no pity for me. Why is it?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Lise!&amp;rdquo; was all Prince Andrew said. But that one word expressed an entreaty, a threat, and above all conviction that she would herself regret her words. But she went on hurriedly:</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;You treat me like an invalid or a child. I see it all! Did you behave like that six months ago?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Lise, I beg you to desist,&amp;rdquo; said Prince Andrew still more emphatically.</p>
    <p>Pierre, who had been growing more and more agitated as he listened to all this, rose and approached the princess. He seemed unable to bear the sight of tears and was ready to cry himself.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Calm yourself, Princess! It seems so to you because.... I assure you I myself have experienced ... and so ... because ... No, excuse me! An outsider is out of place here.... No, don&amp;rsquo;t distress yourself.... Good-by!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Prince Andrew caught him by the hand.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;No, wait, Pierre! The princess is too kind to wish to deprive me of the pleasure of spending the evening with you.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;No, he thinks only of himself,&amp;rdquo; muttered the princess without restraining her angry tears.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Lise!&amp;rdquo; said Prince Andrew dryly, raising his voice to the pitch which indicates that patience is exhausted.</p>
    <p>Suddenly the angry, squirrel-like expression of the princess&amp;rsquo; pretty face changed into a winning and piteous look of fear. Her beautiful eyes glanced askance at her husband&amp;rsquo;s face, and her own assumed the timid, deprecating expression of a dog when it rapidly but feebly wags its drooping tail.</p>
    <p><i>&amp;ldquo;Mon Dieu, mon Dieu!&amp;rdquo;</i> she muttered, and lifting her dress with one hand she went up to her husband and kissed him on the forehead.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Good night, Lise,&amp;rdquo; said he, rising and courteously kissing her hand as he would have done to a stranger.</p>
    <h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
    <p>The friends were silent. Neither cared to begin talking. Pierre continually glanced at Prince Andrew; Prince Andrew rubbed his forehead with his small hand.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Let us go and have supper,&amp;rdquo; he said with a sigh, going to the door.</p>
    <p>They entered the elegant, newly decorated, and luxurious dining room. Everything from the table napkins to the silver, china, and glass bore that imprint of newness found in the households of the newly married. Halfway through supper Prince Andrew leaned his elbows on the table and, with a look of nervous agitation such as Pierre had never before seen on his face, began to talk&amp;mdash;as one who has long had something on his mind and suddenly determines to speak out.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Never, never marry, my dear fellow! That&amp;rsquo;s my advice: never marry till you can say to yourself that you have done all you are capable of, and until you have ceased to love the woman of your choice and have seen her plainly as she is, or else you will make a cruel and irrevocable mistake. Marry when you are old and good for nothing&amp;mdash;or all that is good and noble in you will be lost. It will all be wasted on trifles. Yes! Yes! Yes! Don&amp;rsquo;t look at me with such surprise. If you marry expecting anything from yourself in the future, you will feel at every step that for you all is ended, all is closed except the drawing room, where you will be ranged side by side with a court lackey and an idiot!... But what&amp;rsquo;s the good?...&amp;rdquo; and he waved his arm.</p>
    <p>Pierre took off his spectacles, which made his face seem different and the good-natured expression still more apparent, and gazed at his friend in amazement.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;My wife,&amp;rdquo; continued Prince Andrew, &amp;ldquo;is an excellent woman, one of those rare women with whom a man&amp;rsquo;s honor is safe; but, O God, what would I not give now to be unmarried! You are the first and only one to whom I mention this, because I like you.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>As he said this Prince Andrew was less than ever like that Bolkónski who had lolled in Anna Pávlovna&amp;rsquo;s easy chairs and with half-closed eyes had uttered French phrases between his teeth. Every muscle of his thin face was now quivering with nervous excitement; his eyes, in which the fire of life had seemed extinguished, now flashed with brilliant light. It was evident that the more lifeless he seemed at ordinary times, the more impassioned he became in these moments of almost morbid irritation.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;You don&amp;rsquo;t understand why I say this,&amp;rdquo; he continued, &amp;ldquo;but it is the whole story of life. You talk of Bonaparte and his career,&amp;rdquo; said he (though Pierre had not mentioned Bonaparte), &amp;ldquo;but Bonaparte when he worked went step by step toward his goal. He was free, he had nothing but his aim to consider, and he reached it. But tie yourself up with a woman and, like a chained convict, you lose all freedom! And all you have of hope and strength merely weighs you down and torments you with regret. Drawing rooms, gossip, balls, vanity, and triviality&amp;mdash;these are the enchanted circle I cannot escape from. I am now going to the war, the greatest war there ever was, and I know nothing and am fit for nothing. I am very amiable and have a caustic wit,&amp;rdquo; continued Prince Andrew, &amp;ldquo;and at Anna Pávlovna&amp;rsquo;s they listen to me. And that stupid set without whom my wife cannot exist, and those women.... If you only knew what those society women are, and women in general! My father is right. Selfish, vain, stupid, trivial in everything&amp;mdash;that&amp;rsquo;s what women are when you see them in their true colors! When you meet them in society it seems as if there were something in them, but there&amp;rsquo;s nothing, nothing, nothing! No, don&amp;rsquo;t marry, my dear fellow; don&amp;rsquo;t marry!&amp;rdquo; concluded Prince Andrew.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;It seems funny to me,&amp;rdquo; said Pierre, &amp;ldquo;that <i>you, you</i> should consider yourself incapable and your life a spoiled life. You have everything before you, everything. And you....&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>He did not finish his sentence, but his tone showed how highly he thought of his friend and how much he expected of him in the future.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;How can he talk like that?&amp;rdquo; thought Pierre. He considered his friend a model of perfection because Prince Andrew possessed in the highest degree just the very qualities Pierre lacked, and which might be best described as strength of will. Pierre was always astonished at Prince Andrew&amp;rsquo;s calm manner of treating everybody, his extraordinary memory, his extensive reading (he had read everything, knew everything, and had an opinion about everything), but above all at his capacity for work and study. And if Pierre was often struck by Andrew&amp;rsquo;s lack of capacity for philosophical meditation (to which he himself was particularly addicted), he regarded even this not as a defect but as a sign of strength.</p>
    <p>Even in the best, most friendly and simplest relations of life, praise and commendation are essential, just as grease is necessary to wheels that they may run smoothly.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;My part is played out,&amp;rdquo; said Prince Andrew. &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s the use of talking about me? Let us talk about you,&amp;rdquo; he added after a silence, smiling at his reassuring thoughts.</p>
    <p>That smile was immediately reflected on Pierre&amp;rsquo;s face.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;But what is there to say about me?&amp;rdquo; said Pierre, his face relaxing into a careless, merry smile. &amp;ldquo;What am I? An illegitimate son!&amp;rdquo; He suddenly blushed crimson, and it was plain that he had made a great effort to say this. &amp;ldquo;Without a name and without means... And it really...&amp;rdquo; But he did not say what &amp;ldquo;it really&amp;rdquo; was. &amp;ldquo;For the present I am free and am all right. Only I haven&amp;rsquo;t the least idea what I am to do; I wanted to consult you seriously.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Prince Andrew looked kindly at him, yet his glance&amp;mdash;friendly and affectionate as it was&amp;mdash;expressed a sense of his own superiority.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I am fond of you, especially as you are the one live man among our whole set. Yes, you&amp;rsquo;re all right! Choose what you will; it&amp;rsquo;s all the same. You&amp;rsquo;ll be all right anywhere. But look here: give up visiting those Kurágins and leading that sort of life. It suits you so badly&amp;mdash;all this debauchery, dissipation, and the rest of it!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;What would you have, my dear fellow?&amp;rdquo; answered Pierre, shrugging his shoulders. &amp;ldquo;Women, my dear fellow; women!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t understand it,&amp;rdquo; replied Prince Andrew. &amp;ldquo;Women who are <i>comme il faut</i>, that&amp;rsquo;s a different matter; but the Kurágins&amp;rsquo; set of women, &amp;lsquo;women and wine&amp;rsquo; I don&amp;rsquo;t understand!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Pierre was staying at Prince Vasíli Kurágin&amp;rsquo;s and sharing the dissipated life of his son Anatole, the son whom they were planning to reform by marrying him to Prince Andrew&amp;rsquo;s sister.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Do you know?&amp;rdquo; said Pierre, as if suddenly struck by a happy thought, &amp;ldquo;seriously, I have long been thinking of it.... Leading such a life I can&amp;rsquo;t decide or think properly about anything. One&amp;rsquo;s head aches, and one spends all one&amp;rsquo;s money. He asked me for tonight, but I won&amp;rsquo;t go.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;You give me your word of honor not to go?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;On my honor!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
    <p>It was past one o&amp;rsquo;clock when Pierre left his friend. It was a cloudless, northern, summer night. Pierre took an open cab intending to drive straight home. But the nearer he drew to the house the more he felt the impossibility of going to sleep on such a night. It was light enough to see a long way in the deserted street and it seemed more like morning or evening than night. On the way Pierre remembered that Anatole Kurágin was expecting the usual set for cards that evening, after which there was generally a drinking bout, finishing with visits of a kind Pierre was very fond of.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I should like to go to Kurágin&amp;rsquo;s,&amp;rdquo; thought he.</p>
    <p>But he immediately recalled his promise to Prince Andrew not to go there. Then, as happens to people of weak character, he desired so passionately once more to enjoy that dissipation he was so accustomed to that he decided to go. The thought immediately occurred to him that his promise to Prince Andrew was of no account, because before he gave it he had already promised Prince Anatole to come to his gathering; &amp;ldquo;besides,&amp;rdquo; thought he, &amp;ldquo;all such &amp;lsquo;words of honor&amp;rsquo; are conventional things with no definite meaning, especially if one considers that by tomorrow one may be dead, or something so extraordinary may happen to one that honor and dishonor will be all the same!&amp;rdquo; Pierre often indulged in reflections of this sort, nullifying all his decisions and intentions. He went to Kurágin&amp;rsquo;s.</p>
    <p>Reaching the large house near the Horse Guards&amp;rsquo; barracks, in which Anatole lived, Pierre entered the lighted porch, ascended the stairs, and went in at the open door. There was no one in the anteroom; empty bottles, cloaks, and overshoes were lying about; there was a smell of alcohol, and sounds of voices and shouting in the distance.</p>
    <p>Cards and supper were over, but the visitors had not yet dispersed. Pierre threw off his cloak and entered the first room, in which were the remains of supper. A footman, thinking no one saw him, was drinking on the sly what was left in the glasses. From the third room came sounds of laughter, the shouting of familiar voices, the growling of a bear, and general commotion. Some eight or nine young men were crowding anxiously round an open window. Three others were romping with a young bear, one pulling him by the chain and trying to set him at the others.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I bet a hundred on Stevens!&amp;rdquo; shouted one.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Mind, no holding on!&amp;rdquo; cried another.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I bet on Dólokhov!&amp;rdquo; cried a third. &amp;ldquo;Kurágin, you part our hands.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;There, leave Bruin alone; here&amp;rsquo;s a bet on.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;At one draught, or he loses!&amp;rdquo; shouted a fourth.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Jacob, bring a bottle!&amp;rdquo; shouted the host, a tall, handsome fellow who stood in the midst of the group, without a coat, and with his fine linen shirt unfastened in front. &amp;ldquo;Wait a bit, you fellows.... Here is Pétya! Good man!&amp;rdquo; cried he, addressing Pierre.</p>
    <p>Another voice, from a man of medium height with clear blue eyes, particularly striking among all these drunken voices by its sober ring, cried from the window: &amp;ldquo;Come here; part the bets!&amp;rdquo; This was Dólokhov, an officer of the Semënov regiment, a notorious gambler and duelist, who was living with Anatole. Pierre smiled, looking about him merrily.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t understand. What&amp;rsquo;s it all about?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Wait a bit, he is not drunk yet! A bottle here,&amp;rdquo; said Anatole, and taking a glass from the table he went up to Pierre.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;First of all you must drink!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Pierre drank one glass after another, looking from under his brows at the tipsy guests who were again crowding round the window, and listening to their chatter. Anatole kept on refilling Pierre&amp;rsquo;s glass while explaining that Dólokhov was betting with Stevens, an English naval officer, that he would drink a bottle of rum sitting on the outer ledge of the third floor window with his legs hanging out.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Go on, you must drink it all,&amp;rdquo; said Anatole, giving Pierre the last glass, &amp;ldquo;or I won&amp;rsquo;t let you go!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;No, I won&amp;rsquo;t,&amp;rdquo; said Pierre, pushing Anatole aside, and he went up to the window.</p>
    <p>Dólokhov was holding the Englishman&amp;rsquo;s hand and clearly and distinctly repeating the terms of the bet, addressing himself particularly to Anatole and Pierre.</p>
    <p>Dólokhov was of medium height, with curly hair and light-blue eyes. He was about twenty-five. Like all infantry officers he wore no mustache, so that his mouth, the most striking feature of his face, was clearly seen. The lines of that mouth were remarkably finely curved. The middle of the upper lip formed a sharp wedge and closed firmly on the firm lower one, and something like two distinct smiles played continually round the two corners of the mouth; this, together with the resolute, insolent intelligence of his eyes, produced an effect which made it impossible not to notice his face. Dólokhov was a man of small means and no connections. Yet, though Anatole spent tens of thousands of rubles, Dólokhov lived with him and had placed himself on such a footing that all who knew them, including Anatole himself, respected him more than they did Anatole. Dólokhov could play all games and nearly always won. However much he drank, he never lost his clearheadedness. Both Kurágin and Dólokhov were at that time notorious among the rakes and scapegraces of Petersburg.</p>
    <p>The bottle of rum was brought. The window frame which prevented anyone from sitting on the outer sill was being forced out by two footmen, who were evidently flurried and intimidated by the directions and shouts of the gentlemen around.</p>
    <p>Anatole with his swaggering air strode up to the window. He wanted to smash something. Pushing away the footmen he tugged at the frame, but could not move it. He smashed a pane.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;You have a try, Hercules,&amp;rdquo; said he, turning to Pierre.</p>
    <p>Pierre seized the crossbeam, tugged, and wrenched the oak frame out with a crash.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Take it right out, or they&amp;rsquo;ll think I&amp;rsquo;m holding on,&amp;rdquo; said Dólokhov.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Is the Englishman bragging?... Eh? Is it all right?&amp;rdquo; said Anatole.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;First-rate,&amp;rdquo; said Pierre, looking at Dólokhov, who with a bottle of rum in his hand was approaching the window, from which the light of the sky, the dawn merging with the afterglow of sunset, was visible.</p>
    <p>Dólokhov, the bottle of rum still in his hand, jumped onto the window sill. &amp;ldquo;Listen!&amp;rdquo; cried he, standing there and addressing those in the room. All were silent.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I bet fifty imperials&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;he spoke French that the Englishman might understand him, but he did not speak it very well&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;I bet fifty imperials ... or do you wish to make it a hundred?&amp;rdquo; added he, addressing the Englishman.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;No, fifty,&amp;rdquo; replied the latter.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;All right. Fifty imperials ... that I will drink a whole bottle of rum without taking it from my mouth, sitting outside the window on this spot&amp;rdquo; (he stooped and pointed to the sloping ledge outside the window) &amp;ldquo;and without holding on to anything. Is that right?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Quite right,&amp;rdquo; said the Englishman.</p>
    <p>Anatole turned to the Englishman and taking him by one of the buttons of his coat and looking down at him&amp;mdash;the Englishman was short&amp;mdash;began repeating the terms of the wager to him in English.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Wait!&amp;rdquo; cried Dólokhov, hammering with the bottle on the window sill to attract attention. &amp;ldquo;Wait a bit, Kurágin. Listen! If anyone else does the same, I will pay him a hundred imperials. Do you understand?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The Englishman nodded, but gave no indication whether he intended to accept this challenge or not. Anatole did not release him, and though he kept nodding to show that he understood, Anatole went on translating Dólokhov&amp;rsquo;s words into English. A thin young lad, an hussar of the Life Guards, who had been losing that evening, climbed on the window sill, leaned over, and looked down.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Oh! Oh! Oh!&amp;rdquo; he muttered, looking down from the window at the stones of the pavement.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Shut up!&amp;rdquo; cried Dólokhov, pushing him away from the window. The lad jumped awkwardly back into the room, tripping over his spurs.</p>
    <p>Placing the bottle on the window sill where he could reach it easily, Dólokhov climbed carefully and slowly through the window and lowered his legs. Pressing against both sides of the window, he adjusted himself on his seat, lowered his hands, moved a little to the right and then to the left, and took up the bottle. Anatole brought two candles and placed them on the window sill, though it was already quite light. Dólokhov&amp;rsquo;s back in his white shirt, and his curly head, were lit up from both sides. Everyone crowded to the window, the Englishman in front. Pierre stood smiling but silent. One man, older than the others present, suddenly pushed forward with a scared and angry look and wanted to seize hold of Dólokhov&amp;rsquo;s shirt.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I say, this is folly! He&amp;rsquo;ll be killed,&amp;rdquo; said this more sensible man.</p>
    <p>Anatole stopped him.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t touch him! You&amp;rsquo;ll startle him and then he&amp;rsquo;ll be killed. Eh?... What then?... Eh?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Dólokhov turned round and, again holding on with both hands, arranged himself on his seat.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;If anyone comes meddling again,&amp;rdquo; said he, emitting the words separately through his thin compressed lips, &amp;ldquo;I will throw him down there. Now then!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Saying this he again turned round, dropped his hands, took the bottle and lifted it to his lips, threw back his head, and raised his free hand to balance himself. One of the footmen who had stooped to pick up some broken glass remained in that position without taking his eyes from the window and from Dólokhov&amp;rsquo;s back. Anatole stood erect with staring eyes. The Englishman looked on sideways, pursing up his lips. The man who had wished to stop the affair ran to a corner of the room and threw himself on a sofa with his face to the wall. Pierre hid his face, from which a faint smile forgot to fade though his features now expressed horror and fear. All were still. Pierre took his hands from his eyes. Dólokhov still sat in the same position, only his head was thrown further back till his curly hair touched his shirt collar, and the hand holding the bottle was lifted higher and higher and trembled with the effort. The bottle was emptying perceptibly and rising still higher and his head tilting yet further back. &amp;ldquo;Why is it so long?&amp;rdquo; thought Pierre. It seemed to him that more than half an hour had elapsed. Suddenly Dólokhov made a backward movement with his spine, and his arm trembled nervously; this was sufficient to cause his whole body to slip as he sat on the sloping ledge. As he began slipping down, his head and arm wavered still more with the strain. One hand moved as if to clutch the window sill, but refrained from touching it. Pierre again covered his eyes and thought he would never open them again. Suddenly he was aware of a stir all around. He looked up: Dólokhov was standing on the window sill, with a pale but radiant face.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s empty.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>He threw the bottle to the Englishman, who caught it neatly. Dólokhov jumped down. He smelt strongly of rum.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well done!... Fine fellow!... There&amp;rsquo;s a bet for you!... Devil take you!&amp;rdquo; came from different sides.</p>
    <p>The Englishman took out his purse and began counting out the money. Dólokhov stood frowning and did not speak. Pierre jumped upon the window sill.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Gentlemen, who wishes to bet with me? I&amp;rsquo;ll do the same thing!&amp;rdquo; he suddenly cried. &amp;ldquo;Even without a bet, there! Tell them to bring me a bottle. I&amp;rsquo;ll do it.... Bring a bottle!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Let him do it, let him do it,&amp;rdquo; said Dólokhov, smiling.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;What next? Have you gone mad?... No one would let you!... Why, you go giddy even on a staircase,&amp;rdquo; exclaimed several voices.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll drink it! Let&amp;rsquo;s have a bottle of rum!&amp;rdquo; shouted Pierre, banging the table with a determined and drunken gesture and preparing to climb out of the window.</p>
    <p>They seized him by his arms; but he was so strong that everyone who touched him was sent flying.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;No, you&amp;rsquo;ll never manage him that way,&amp;rdquo; said Anatole. &amp;ldquo;Wait a bit and I&amp;rsquo;ll get round him.... Listen! I&amp;rsquo;ll take your bet tomorrow, but now we are all going to &amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;rsquo;s.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Come on then,&amp;rdquo; cried Pierre. &amp;ldquo;Come on!... And we&amp;rsquo;ll take Bruin with us.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>And he caught the bear, took it in his arms, lifted it from the ground, and began dancing round the room with it.</p>
    <h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
    <p>Prince Vasíli kept the promise he had given to Princess Drubetskáya who had spoken to him on behalf of her only son Borís on the evening of Anna Pávlovna&amp;rsquo;s soiree. The matter was mentioned to the Emperor, an exception made, and Borís transferred into the regiment of Semënov Guards with the rank of cornet. He received, however, no appointment to Kutúzov&amp;rsquo;s staff despite all Anna Mikháylovna&amp;rsquo;s endeavors and entreaties. Soon after Anna Pávlovna&amp;rsquo;s reception Anna Mikháylovna returned to Moscow and went straight to her rich relations, the Rostóvs, with whom she stayed when in the town and where her darling Bóry, who had only just entered a regiment of the line and was being at once transferred to the Guards as a cornet, had been educated from childhood and lived for years at a time. The Guards had already left Petersburg on the tenth of August, and her son, who had remained in Moscow for his equipment, was to join them on the march to Radzivílov.</p>
    <p>It was St. Natalia&amp;rsquo;s day and the name day of two of the Rostóvs&amp;mdash;the mother and the youngest daughter&amp;mdash;both named Nataly. Ever since the morning, carriages with six horses had been coming and going continually, bringing visitors to the Countess Rostóva&amp;rsquo;s big house on the Povarskáya, so well known to all Moscow. The countess herself and her handsome eldest daughter were in the drawing room with the visitors who came to congratulate, and who constantly succeeded one another in relays.</p>
    <p>The countess was a woman of about forty-five, with a thin Oriental type of face, evidently worn out with childbearing&amp;mdash;she had had twelve. A languor of motion and speech, resulting from weakness, gave her a distinguished air which inspired respect. Princess Anna Mikháylovna Drubetskáya, who as a member of the household was also seated in the drawing room, helped to receive and entertain the visitors. The young people were in one of the inner rooms, not considering it necessary to take part in receiving the visitors. The count met the guests and saw them off, inviting them all to dinner.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I am very, very grateful to you, <i>mon cher</i>,&amp;rdquo; or <i>&amp;ldquo;ma chère&amp;rdquo;</i>&amp;mdash;he called everyone without exception and without the slightest variation in his tone, &amp;ldquo;my dear,&amp;rdquo; whether they were above or below him in rank&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;I thank you for myself and for our two dear ones whose name day we are keeping. But mind you come to dinner or I shall be offended, <i>ma chère!</i> On behalf of the whole family I beg you to come, <i>mon cher!</i>&amp;rdquo; These words he repeated to everyone without exception or variation, and with the same expression on his full, cheerful, clean-shaven face, the same firm pressure of the hand and the same quick, repeated bows. As soon as he had seen a visitor off he returned to one of those who were still in the drawing room, drew a chair toward him or her, and jauntily spreading out his legs and putting his hands on his knees with the air of a man who enjoys life and knows how to live, he swayed to and fro with dignity, offered surmises about the weather, or touched on questions of health, sometimes in Russian and sometimes in very bad but self-confident French; then again, like a man weary but unflinching in the fulfillment of duty, he rose to see some visitors off and, stroking his scanty gray hairs over his bald patch, also asked them to dinner. Sometimes on his way back from the anteroom he would pass through the conservatory and pantry into the large marble dining hall, where tables were being set out for eighty people; and looking at the footmen, who were bringing in silver and china, moving tables, and unfolding damask table linen, he would call Dmítri Vasílevich, a man of good family and the manager of all his affairs, and while looking with pleasure at the enormous table would say: &amp;ldquo;Well, Dmítri, you&amp;rsquo;ll see that things are all as they should be? That&amp;rsquo;s right! The great thing is the serving, that&amp;rsquo;s it.&amp;rdquo; And with a complacent sigh he would return to the drawing room.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Márya Lvóvna Karágina and her daughter!&amp;rdquo; announced the countess&amp;rsquo; gigantic footman in his bass voice, entering the drawing room. The countess reflected a moment and took a pinch from a gold snuffbox with her husband&amp;rsquo;s portrait on it.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m quite worn out by these callers. However, I&amp;rsquo;ll see her and no more. She is so affected. Ask her in,&amp;rdquo; she said to the footman in a sad voice, as if saying: &amp;ldquo;Very well, finish me off.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>A tall, stout, and proud-looking woman, with a round-faced smiling daughter, entered the drawing room, their dresses rustling.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Dear Countess, what an age... She has been laid up, poor child ... at the Razumóvski&amp;rsquo;s ball ... and Countess Apráksina ... I was so delighted...&amp;rdquo; came the sounds of animated feminine voices, interrupting one another and mingling with the rustling of dresses and the scraping of chairs. Then one of those conversations began which last out until, at the first pause, the guests rise with a rustle of dresses and say, &amp;ldquo;I am so delighted... Mamma&amp;rsquo;s health... and Countess Apráksina...&amp;rdquo; and then, again rustling, pass into the anteroom, put on cloaks or mantles, and drive away. The conversation was on the chief topic of the day: the illness of the wealthy and celebrated beau of Catherine&amp;rsquo;s day, Count Bezúkhov, and about his illegitimate son Pierre, the one who had behaved so improperly at Anna Pávlovna&amp;rsquo;s reception.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I am so sorry for the poor count,&amp;rdquo; said the visitor. &amp;ldquo;He is in such bad health, and now this vexation about his son is enough to kill him!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;What is that?&amp;rdquo; asked the countess as if she did not know what the visitor alluded to, though she had already heard about the cause of Count Bezúkhov&amp;rsquo;s distress some fifteen times.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s what comes of a modern education,&amp;rdquo; exclaimed the visitor. &amp;ldquo;It seems that while he was abroad this young man was allowed to do as he liked, now in Petersburg I hear he has been doing such terrible things that he has been expelled by the police.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;You don&amp;rsquo;t say so!&amp;rdquo; replied the countess.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;He chose his friends badly,&amp;rdquo; interposed Anna Mikháylovna. &amp;ldquo;Prince Vasíli&amp;rsquo;s son, he, and a certain Dólokhov have, it is said, been up to heaven only knows what! And they have had to suffer for it. Dólokhov has been degraded to the ranks and Bezúkhov&amp;rsquo;s son sent back to Moscow. Anatole Kurágin&amp;rsquo;s father managed somehow to get his son&amp;rsquo;s affair hushed up, but even he was ordered out of Petersburg.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;But what have they been up to?&amp;rdquo; asked the countess.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;They are regular brigands, especially Dólokhov,&amp;rdquo; replied the visitor. &amp;ldquo;He is a son of Márya Ivánovna Dólokhova, such a worthy woman, but there, just fancy! Those three got hold of a bear somewhere, put it in a carriage, and set off with it to visit some actresses! The police tried to interfere, and what did the young men do? They tied a policeman and the bear back to back and put the bear into the Moyka Canal. And there was the bear swimming about with the policeman on his back!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;What a nice figure the policeman must have cut, my dear!&amp;rdquo; shouted the count, dying with laughter.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Oh, how dreadful! How can you laugh at it, Count?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Yet the ladies themselves could not help laughing.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;It was all they could do to rescue the poor man,&amp;rdquo; continued the visitor. &amp;ldquo;And to think it is Cyril Vladímirovich Bezúkhov&amp;rsquo;s son who amuses himself in this sensible manner! And he was said to be so well educated and clever. This is all that his foreign education has done for him! I hope that here in Moscow no one will receive him, in spite of his money. They wanted to introduce him to me, but I quite declined: I have my daughters to consider.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Why do you say this young man is so rich?&amp;rdquo; asked the countess, turning away from the girls, who at once assumed an air of inattention. &amp;ldquo;His children are all illegitimate. I think Pierre also is illegitimate.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The visitor made a gesture with her hand.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I should think he has a score of them.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Princess Anna Mikháylovna intervened in the conversation, evidently wishing to show her connections and knowledge of what went on in society.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;The fact of the matter is,&amp;rdquo; said she significantly, and also in a half whisper, &amp;ldquo;everyone knows Count Cyril&amp;rsquo;s reputation.... He has lost count of his children, but this Pierre was his favorite.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;How handsome the old man still was only a year ago!&amp;rdquo; remarked the countess. &amp;ldquo;I have never seen a handsomer man.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;He is very much altered now,&amp;rdquo; said Anna Mikháylovna. &amp;ldquo;Well, as I was saying, Prince Vasíli is the next heir through his wife, but the count is very fond of Pierre, looked after his education, and wrote to the Emperor about him; so that in the case of his death&amp;mdash;and he is so ill that he may die at any moment, and Dr. Lorrain has come from Petersburg&amp;mdash;no one knows who will inherit his immense fortune, Pierre or Prince Vasíli. Forty thousand serfs and millions of rubles! I know it all very well for Prince Vasíli told me himself. Besides, Cyril Vladímirovich is my mother&amp;rsquo;s second cousin. He&amp;rsquo;s also my Bóry&amp;rsquo;s godfather,&amp;rdquo; she added, as if she attached no importance at all to the fact.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Prince Vasíli arrived in Moscow yesterday. I hear he has come on some inspection business,&amp;rdquo; remarked the visitor.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Yes, but between ourselves,&amp;rdquo; said the princess, &amp;ldquo;that is a pretext. The fact is he has come to see Count Cyril Vladímirovich, hearing how ill he is.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;But do you know, my dear, that was a capital joke,&amp;rdquo; said the count; and seeing that the elder visitor was not listening, he turned to the young ladies. &amp;ldquo;I can just imagine what a funny figure that policeman cut!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>And as he waved his arms to impersonate the policeman, his portly form again shook with a deep ringing laugh, the laugh of one who always eats well and, in particular, drinks well. &amp;ldquo;So do come and dine with us!&amp;rdquo; he said.</p>
    <h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
    <p>Silence ensued. The countess looked at her callers, smiling affably, but not concealing the fact that she would not be distressed if they now rose and took their leave. The visitor&amp;rsquo;s daughter was already smoothing down her dress with an inquiring look at her mother, when suddenly from the next room were heard the footsteps of boys and girls running to the door and the noise of a chair falling over, and a girl of thirteen, hiding something in the folds of her short muslin frock, darted in and stopped short in the middle of the room. It was evident that she had not intended her flight to bring her so far. Behind her in the doorway appeared a student with a crimson coat collar, an officer of the Guards, a girl of fifteen, and a plump rosy-faced boy in a short jacket.</p>
    <p>The count jumped up and, swaying from side to side, spread his arms wide and threw them round the little girl who had run in.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Ah, here she is!&amp;rdquo; he exclaimed laughing. &amp;ldquo;My pet, whose name day it is. My dear pet!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;<i>Ma chère</i>, there is a time for everything,&amp;rdquo; said the countess with feigned severity. &amp;ldquo;You spoil her, Ilyá,&amp;rdquo; she added, turning to her husband.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;How do you do, my dear? I wish you many happy returns of your name day,&amp;rdquo; said the visitor. &amp;ldquo;What a charming child,&amp;rdquo; she added, addressing the mother.</p>
    <p>This black-eyed, wide-mouthed girl, not pretty but full of life&amp;mdash;with childish bare shoulders which after her run heaved and shook her bodice, with black curls tossed backward, thin bare arms, little legs in lace-frilled drawers, and feet in low slippers&amp;mdash;was just at that charming age when a girl is no longer a child, though the child is not yet a young woman. Escaping from her father she ran to hide her flushed face in the lace of her mother&amp;rsquo;s mantilla&amp;mdash;not paying the least attention to her severe remark&amp;mdash;and began to laugh. She laughed, and in fragmentary sentences tried to explain about a doll which she produced from the folds of her frock.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Do you see?... My doll... Mimi... You see...&amp;rdquo; was all Natásha managed to utter (to her everything seemed funny). She leaned against her mother and burst into such a loud, ringing fit of laughter that even the prim visitor could not help joining in.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Now then, go away and take your monstrosity with you,&amp;rdquo; said the mother, pushing away her daughter with pretended sternness, and turning to the visitor she added: &amp;ldquo;She is my youngest girl.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Natásha, raising her face for a moment from her mother&amp;rsquo;s mantilla, glanced up at her through tears of laughter, and again hid her face.</p>
    <p>The visitor, compelled to look on at this family scene, thought it necessary to take some part in it.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Tell me, my dear,&amp;rdquo; said she to Natásha, &amp;ldquo;is Mimi a relation of yours? A daughter, I suppose?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Natásha did not like the visitor&amp;rsquo;s tone of condescension to childish things. She did not reply, but looked at her seriously.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile the younger generation: Borís, the officer, Anna Mikháylovna&amp;rsquo;s son; Nicholas, the undergraduate, the count&amp;rsquo;s eldest son; Sónya, the count&amp;rsquo;s fifteen-year-old niece, and little Pétya, his youngest boy, had all settled down in the drawing room and were obviously trying to restrain within the bounds of decorum the excitement and mirth that shone in all their faces. Evidently in the back rooms, from which they had dashed out so impetuously, the conversation had been more amusing than the drawing room talk of society scandals, the weather, and Countess Apráksina. Now and then they glanced at one another, hardly able to suppress their laughter.</p>
    <p>The two young men, the student and the officer, friends from childhood, were of the same age and both handsome fellows, though not alike. Borís was tall and fair, and his calm and handsome face had regular, delicate features. Nicholas was short with curly hair and an open expression. Dark hairs were already showing on his upper lip, and his whole face expressed impetuosity and enthusiasm. Nicholas blushed when he entered the drawing room. He evidently tried to find something to say, but failed. Borís on the contrary at once found his footing, and related quietly and humorously how he had known that doll Mimi when she was still quite a young lady, before her nose was broken; how she had aged during the five years he had known her, and how her head had cracked right across the skull. Having said this he glanced at Natásha. She turned away from him and glanced at her younger brother, who was screwing up his eyes and shaking with suppressed laughter, and unable to control herself any longer, she jumped up and rushed from the room as fast as her nimble little feet would carry her. Borís did not laugh.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;You were meaning to go out, weren&amp;rsquo;t you, Mamma? Do you want the carriage?&amp;rdquo; he asked his mother with a smile.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Yes, yes, go and tell them to get it ready,&amp;rdquo; she answered, returning his smile.</p>
    <p>Borís quietly left the room and went in search of Natásha. The plump boy ran after them angrily, as if vexed that their program had been disturbed.</p>
    <h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
    <p>The only young people remaining in the drawing room, not counting the young lady visitor and the countess&amp;rsquo; eldest daughter (who was four years older than her sister and behaved already like a grown-up person), were Nicholas and Sónya, the niece. Sónya was a slender little brunette with a tender look in her eyes which were veiled by long lashes, thick black plaits coiling twice round her head, and a tawny tint in her complexion and especially in the color of her slender but graceful and muscular arms and neck. By the grace of her movements, by the softness and flexibility of her small limbs, and by a certain coyness and reserve of manner, she reminded one of a pretty, half-grown kitten which promises to become a beautiful little cat. She evidently considered it proper to show an interest in the general conversation by smiling, but in spite of herself her eyes under their thick long lashes watched her cousin who was going to join the army, with such passionate girlish adoration that her smile could not for a single instant impose upon anyone, and it was clear that the kitten had settled down only to spring up with more energy and again play with her cousin as soon as they too could, like Natásha and Borís, escape from the drawing room.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Ah yes, my dear,&amp;rdquo; said the count, addressing the visitor and pointing to Nicholas, &amp;ldquo;his friend Borís has become an officer, and so for friendship&amp;rsquo;s sake he is leaving the university and me, his old father, and entering the military service, my dear. And there was a place and everything waiting for him in the Archives Department! Isn&amp;rsquo;t that friendship?&amp;rdquo; remarked the count in an inquiring tone.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;But they say that war has been declared,&amp;rdquo; replied the visitor.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;They&amp;rsquo;ve been saying so a long while,&amp;rdquo; said the count, &amp;ldquo;and they&amp;rsquo;ll say so again and again, and that will be the end of it. My dear, there&amp;rsquo;s friendship for you,&amp;rdquo; he repeated. &amp;ldquo;He&amp;rsquo;s joining the hussars.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The visitor, not knowing what to say, shook her head.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s not at all from friendship,&amp;rdquo; declared Nicholas, flaring up and turning away as if from a shameful aspersion. &amp;ldquo;It is not from friendship at all; I simply feel that the army is my vocation.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>He glanced at his cousin and the young lady visitor; and they were both regarding him with a smile of approbation.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Schubert, the colonel of the Pávlograd Hussars, is dining with us today. He has been here on leave and is taking Nicholas back with him. It can&amp;rsquo;t be helped!&amp;rdquo; said the count, shrugging his shoulders and speaking playfully of a matter that evidently distressed him.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I have already told you, Papa,&amp;rdquo; said his son, &amp;ldquo;that if you don&amp;rsquo;t wish to let me go, I&amp;rsquo;ll stay. But I know I am no use anywhere except in the army; I am not a diplomat or a government clerk.&amp;mdash;I don&amp;rsquo;t know how to hide what I feel.&amp;rdquo; As he spoke he kept glancing with the flirtatiousness of a handsome youth at Sónya and the young lady visitor.</p>
    <p>The little kitten, feasting her eyes on him, seemed ready at any moment to start her gambols again and display her kittenish nature.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;All right, all right!&amp;rdquo; said the old count. &amp;ldquo;He always flares up! This Buonaparte has turned all their heads; they all think of how he rose from an ensign and became Emperor. Well, well, God grant it,&amp;rdquo; he added, not noticing his visitor&amp;rsquo;s sarcastic smile.</p>
    <p>The elders began talking about Bonaparte. Julie Karágina turned to young Rostóv.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;What a pity you weren&amp;rsquo;t at the Arkhárovs&amp;rsquo; on Thursday. It was so dull without you,&amp;rdquo; said she, giving him a tender smile.</p>
    <p>The young man, flattered, sat down nearer to her with a coquettish smile, and engaged the smiling Julie in a confidential conversation without at all noticing that his involuntary smile had stabbed the heart of Sónya, who blushed and smiled unnaturally. In the midst of his talk he glanced round at her. She gave him a passionately angry glance, and hardly able to restrain her tears and maintain the artificial smile on her lips, she got up and left the room. All Nicholas&amp;rsquo; animation vanished. He waited for the first pause in the conversation, and then with a distressed face left the room to find Sónya.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;How plainly all these young people wear their hearts on their sleeves!&amp;rdquo; said Anna Mikháylovna, pointing to Nicholas as he went out. <i>&amp;ldquo;Cousinage&amp;mdash;dangereux voisinage,&amp;rdquo;</i> * she added.</p>
    <pre class="testable">* Cousinhood is a dangerous neighborhood.</pre>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Yes,&amp;rdquo; said the countess when the brightness these young people had brought into the room had vanished; and as if answering a question no one had put but which was always in her mind, &amp;ldquo;and how much suffering, how much anxiety one has had to go through that we might rejoice in them now! And yet really the anxiety is greater now than the joy. One is always, always anxious! Especially just at this age, so dangerous both for girls and boys.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;It all depends on the bringing up,&amp;rdquo; remarked the visitor.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Yes, you&amp;rsquo;re quite right,&amp;rdquo; continued the countess. &amp;ldquo;Till now I have always, thank God, been my children&amp;rsquo;s friend and had their full confidence,&amp;rdquo; said she, repeating the mistake of so many parents who imagine that their children have no secrets from them. &amp;ldquo;I know I shall always be my daughters&amp;rsquo; first confidante, and that if Nicholas, with his impulsive nature, does get into mischief (a boy can&amp;rsquo;t help it), he will all the same never be like those Petersburg young men.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Yes, they are splendid, splendid youngsters,&amp;rdquo; chimed in the count, who always solved questions that seemed to him perplexing by deciding that everything was splendid. &amp;ldquo;Just fancy: wants to be an hussar. What&amp;rsquo;s one to do, my dear?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;What a charming creature your younger girl is,&amp;rdquo; said the visitor; &amp;ldquo;a little volcano!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Yes, a regular volcano,&amp;rdquo; said the count. &amp;ldquo;Takes after me! And what a voice she has; though she&amp;rsquo;s my daughter, I tell the truth when I say she&amp;rsquo;ll be a singer, a second Salomoni! We have engaged an Italian to give her lessons.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Isn&amp;rsquo;t she too young? I have heard that it harms the voice to train it at that age.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Oh no, not at all too young!&amp;rdquo; replied the count. &amp;ldquo;Why, our mothers used to be married at twelve or thirteen.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;And she&amp;rsquo;s in love with Borís already. Just fancy!&amp;rdquo; said the countess with a gentle smile, looking at Borís and went on, evidently concerned with a thought that always occupied her: &amp;ldquo;Now you see if I were to be severe with her and to forbid it ... goodness knows what they might be up to on the sly&amp;rdquo; (she meant that they would be kissing), &amp;ldquo;but as it is, I know every word she utters. She will come running to me of her own accord in the evening and tell me everything. Perhaps I spoil her, but really that seems the best plan. With her elder sister I was stricter.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Yes, I was brought up quite differently,&amp;rdquo; remarked the handsome elder daughter, Countess Véra, with a smile.</p>
    <p>But the smile did not enhance Véra&amp;rsquo;s beauty as smiles generally do; on the contrary it gave her an unnatural, and therefore unpleasant, expression. Véra was good-looking, not at all stupid, quick at learning, was well brought up, and had a pleasant voice; what she said was true and appropriate, yet, strange to say, everyone&amp;mdash;the visitors and countess alike&amp;mdash;turned to look at her as if wondering why she had said it, and they all felt awkward.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;People are always too clever with their eldest children and try to make something exceptional of them,&amp;rdquo; said the visitor.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s the good of denying it, my dear? Our dear countess was too clever with Véra,&amp;rdquo; said the count. &amp;ldquo;Well, what of that? She&amp;rsquo;s turned out splendidly all the same,&amp;rdquo; he added, winking at Véra.</p>
    <p>The guests got up and took their leave, promising to return to dinner.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;What manners! I thought they would never go,&amp;rdquo; said the countess, when she had seen her guests out.</p>
    <h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
    <p>When Natásha ran out of the drawing room she only went as far as the conservatory. There she paused and stood listening to the conversation in the drawing room, waiting for Borís to come out. She was already growing impatient, and stamped her foot, ready to cry at his not coming at once, when she heard the young man&amp;rsquo;s discreet steps approaching neither quickly nor slowly. At this Natásha dashed swiftly among the flower tubs and hid there.</p>
    <p>Borís paused in the middle of the room, looked round, brushed a little dust from the sleeve of his uniform, and going up to a mirror examined his handsome face. Natásha, very still, peered out from her ambush, waiting to see what he would do. He stood a little while before the glass, smiled, and walked toward the other door. Natásha was about to call him but changed her mind. &amp;ldquo;Let him look for me,&amp;rdquo; thought she. Hardly had Borís gone than Sónya, flushed, in tears, and muttering angrily, came in at the other door. Natásha checked her first impulse to run out to her, and remained in her hiding place, watching&amp;mdash;as under an invisible cap&amp;mdash;to see what went on in the world. She was experiencing a new and peculiar pleasure. Sónya, muttering to herself, kept looking round toward the drawing room door. It opened and Nicholas came in.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Sónya, what is the matter with you? How can you?&amp;rdquo; said he, running up to her.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s nothing, nothing; leave me alone!&amp;rdquo; sobbed Sónya.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Ah, I know what it is.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well, if you do, so much the better, and you can go back to her!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Só-o-onya! Look here! How can you torture me and yourself like that, for a mere fancy?&amp;rdquo; said Nicholas taking her hand.</p>
    <p>Sónya did not pull it away, and left off crying. Natásha, not stirring and scarcely breathing, watched from her ambush with sparkling eyes. &amp;ldquo;What will happen now?&amp;rdquo; thought she.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Sónya! What is anyone in the world to me? You alone are everything!&amp;rdquo; said Nicholas. &amp;ldquo;And I will prove it to you.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t like you to talk like that.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well, then, I won&amp;rsquo;t; only forgive me, Sónya!&amp;rdquo; He drew her to him and kissed her.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Oh, how nice,&amp;rdquo; thought Natásha; and when Sónya and Nicholas had gone out of the conservatory she followed and called Borís to her.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Borís, come here,&amp;rdquo; said she with a sly and significant look. &amp;ldquo;I have something to tell you. Here, here!&amp;rdquo; and she led him into the conservatory to the place among the tubs where she had been hiding.</p>
    <p>Borís followed her, smiling.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;What is the <i>something?</i>&amp;rdquo; asked he.</p>
    <p>She grew confused, glanced round, and, seeing the doll she had thrown down on one of the tubs, picked it up.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Kiss the doll,&amp;rdquo; said she.</p>
    <p>Borís looked attentively and kindly at her eager face, but did not reply.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t you want to? Well, then, come here,&amp;rdquo; said she, and went further in among the plants and threw down the doll. &amp;ldquo;Closer, closer!&amp;rdquo; she whispered.</p>
    <p>She caught the young officer by his cuffs, and a look of solemnity and fear appeared on her flushed face.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;And me? Would you like to kiss me?&amp;rdquo; she whispered almost inaudibly, glancing up at him from under her brows, smiling, and almost crying from excitement.</p>
    <p>Borís blushed.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;How funny you are!&amp;rdquo; he said, bending down to her and blushing still more, but he waited and did nothing.</p>
    <p>Suddenly she jumped up onto a tub to be higher than he, embraced him so that both her slender bare arms clasped him above his neck, and, tossing back her hair, kissed him full on the lips.</p>
    <p>Then she slipped down among the flowerpots on the other side of the tubs and stood, hanging her head.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Natásha,&amp;rdquo; he said, &amp;ldquo;you know that I love you, but....&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;You are in love with me?&amp;rdquo; Natásha broke in.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Yes, I am, but please don&amp;rsquo;t let us do like that.... In another four years ... then I will ask for your hand.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Natásha considered.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen,&amp;rdquo; she counted on her slender little fingers. &amp;ldquo;All right! Then it&amp;rsquo;s settled?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>A smile of joy and satisfaction lit up her eager face.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Settled!&amp;rdquo; replied Borís.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Forever?&amp;rdquo; said the little girl. &amp;ldquo;Till death itself?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>She took his arm and with a happy face went with him into the adjoining sitting room.</p>
    <h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
    <p>After receiving her visitors, the countess was so tired that she gave orders to admit no more, but the porter was told to be sure to invite to dinner all who came &amp;ldquo;to congratulate.&amp;rdquo; The countess wished to have a tête-à-tête talk with the friend of her childhood, Princess Anna Mikháylovna, whom she had not seen properly since she returned from Petersburg. Anna Mikháylovna, with her tear-worn but pleasant face, drew her chair nearer to that of the countess.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;With you I will be quite frank,&amp;rdquo; said Anna Mikháylovna. &amp;ldquo;There are not many left of us old friends! That&amp;rsquo;s why I so value your friendship.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Anna Mikháylovna looked at Véra and paused. The countess pressed her friend&amp;rsquo;s hand.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Véra,&amp;rdquo; she said to her eldest daughter who was evidently not a favorite, &amp;ldquo;how is it you have so little tact? Don&amp;rsquo;t you see you are not wanted here? Go to the other girls, or...&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The handsome Véra smiled contemptuously but did not seem at all hurt.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;If you had told me sooner, Mamma, I would have gone,&amp;rdquo; she replied as she rose to go to her own room.</p>
    <p>But as she passed the sitting room she noticed two couples sitting, one pair at each window. She stopped and smiled scornfully. Sónya was sitting close to Nicholas who was copying out some verses for her, the first he had ever written. Borís and Natásha were at the other window and ceased talking when Véra entered. Sónya and Natásha looked at Véra with guilty, happy faces.</p>
    <p>It was pleasant and touching to see these little girls in love; but apparently the sight of them roused no pleasant feeling in Véra.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;How often have I asked you not to take my things?&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;You have a room of your own,&amp;rdquo; and she took the inkstand from Nicholas.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;In a minute, in a minute,&amp;rdquo; he said, dipping his pen.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;You always manage to do things at the wrong time,&amp;rdquo; continued Véra. &amp;ldquo;You came rushing into the drawing room so that everyone felt ashamed of you.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Though what she said was quite just, perhaps for that very reason no one replied, and the four simply looked at one another. She lingered in the room with the inkstand in her hand.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;And at your age what secrets can there be between Natásha and Borís, or between you two? It&amp;rsquo;s all nonsense!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Now, Véra, what does it matter to you?&amp;rdquo; said Natásha in defense, speaking very gently.</p>
    <p>She seemed that day to be more than ever kind and affectionate to everyone.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Very silly,&amp;rdquo; said Véra. &amp;ldquo;I am ashamed of you. Secrets indeed!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;All have secrets of their own,&amp;rdquo; answered Natásha, getting warmer. &amp;ldquo;We don&amp;rsquo;t interfere with you and Berg.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I should think not,&amp;rdquo; said Véra, &amp;ldquo;because there can never be anything wrong in my behavior. But I&amp;rsquo;ll just tell Mamma how you are behaving with Borís.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Natálya Ilyníchna behaves very well to me,&amp;rdquo; remarked Borís. &amp;ldquo;I have nothing to complain of.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t, Borís! You are such a diplomat that it is really tiresome,&amp;rdquo; said Natásha in a mortified voice that trembled slightly. (She used the word &amp;ldquo;diplomat,&amp;rdquo; which was just then much in vogue among the children, in the special sense they attached to it.) &amp;ldquo;Why does she bother me?&amp;rdquo; And she added, turning to Véra, &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;ll never understand it, because you&amp;rsquo;ve never loved anyone. You have no heart! You are a Madame de Genlis and nothing more&amp;rdquo; (this nickname, bestowed on Véra by Nicholas, was considered very stinging), &amp;ldquo;and your greatest pleasure is to be unpleasant to people! Go and flirt with Berg as much as you please,&amp;rdquo; she finished quickly.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I shall at any rate not run after a young man before visitors...&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well, now you&amp;rsquo;ve done what you wanted,&amp;rdquo; put in Nicholas&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;said unpleasant things to everyone and upset them. Let&amp;rsquo;s go to the nursery.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>All four, like a flock of scared birds, got up and left the room.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;The unpleasant things were said to me,&amp;rdquo; remarked Véra, &amp;ldquo;I said none to anyone.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Madame de Genlis! Madame de Genlis!&amp;rdquo; shouted laughing voices through the door.</p>
    <p>The handsome Véra, who produced such an irritating and unpleasant effect on everyone, smiled and, evidently unmoved by what had been said to her, went to the looking glass and arranged her hair and scarf. Looking at her own handsome face she seemed to become still colder and calmer.</p>
    <p>In the drawing room the conversation was still going on.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Ah, my dear,&amp;rdquo; said the countess, &amp;ldquo;my life is not all roses either. Don&amp;rsquo;t I know that at the rate we are living our means won&amp;rsquo;t last long? It&amp;rsquo;s all the Club and his easygoing nature. Even in the country do we get any rest? Theatricals, hunting, and heaven knows what besides! But don&amp;rsquo;t let&amp;rsquo;s talk about me; tell me how you managed everything. I often wonder at you, Annette&amp;mdash;how at your age you can rush off alone in a carriage to Moscow, to Petersburg, to those ministers and great people, and know how to deal with them all! It&amp;rsquo;s quite astonishing. How did you get things settled? I couldn&amp;rsquo;t possibly do it.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Ah, my love,&amp;rdquo; answered Anna Mikháylovna, &amp;ldquo;God grant you never know what it is to be left a widow without means and with a son you love to distraction! One learns many things then,&amp;rdquo; she added with a certain pride. &amp;ldquo;That lawsuit taught me much. When I want to see one of those big people I write a note: &amp;lsquo;Princess So-and-So desires an interview with So and-So,&amp;rsquo; and then I take a cab and go myself two, three, or four times&amp;mdash;till I get what I want. I don&amp;rsquo;t mind what they think of me.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well, and to whom did you apply about Bóry?&amp;rdquo; asked the countess. &amp;ldquo;You see yours is already an officer in the Guards, while my Nicholas is going as a cadet. There&amp;rsquo;s no one to interest himself for him. To whom did you apply?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;To Prince Vasíli. He was so kind. He at once agreed to everything, and put the matter before the Emperor,&amp;rdquo; said Princess Anna Mikháylovna enthusiastically, quite forgetting all the humiliation she had endured to gain her end.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Has Prince Vasíli aged much?&amp;rdquo; asked the countess. &amp;ldquo;I have not seen him since we acted together at the Rumyántsovs&amp;rsquo; theatricals. I expect he has forgotten me. He paid me attentions in those days,&amp;rdquo; said the countess, with a smile.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;He is just the same as ever,&amp;rdquo; replied Anna Mikháylovna, &amp;ldquo;overflowing with amiability. His position has not turned his head at all. He said to me, &amp;lsquo;I am sorry I can do so little for you, dear Princess. I am at your command.&amp;rsquo; Yes, he is a fine fellow and a very kind relation. But, Nataly, you know my love for my son: I would do anything for his happiness! And my affairs are in such a bad way that my position is now a terrible one,&amp;rdquo; continued Anna Mikháylovna, sadly, dropping her voice. &amp;ldquo;My wretched lawsuit takes all I have and makes no progress. Would you believe it, I have literally not a penny and don&amp;rsquo;t know how to equip Borís.&amp;rdquo; She took out her handkerchief and began to cry. &amp;ldquo;I need five hundred rubles, and have only one twenty-five-ruble note. I am in such a state.... My only hope now is in Count Cyril Vladímirovich Bezúkhov. If he will not assist his godson&amp;mdash;you know he is Bóry&amp;rsquo;s godfather&amp;mdash;and allow him something for his maintenance, all my trouble will have been thrown away.... I shall not be able to equip him.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The countess&amp;rsquo; eyes filled with tears and she pondered in silence.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I often think, though, perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s a sin,&amp;rdquo; said the princess, &amp;ldquo;that here lives Count Cyril Vladímirovich Bezúkhov so rich, all alone... that tremendous fortune... and what is his life worth? It&amp;rsquo;s a burden to him, and Bóry&amp;rsquo;s life is only just beginning....&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Surely he will leave something to Borís,&amp;rdquo; said the countess.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Heaven only knows, my dear! These rich grandees are so selfish. Still, I will take Borís and go to see him at once, and I shall speak to him straight out. Let people think what they will of me, it&amp;rsquo;s really all the same to me when my son&amp;rsquo;s fate is at stake.&amp;rdquo; The princess rose. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s now two o&amp;rsquo;clock and you dine at four. There will just be time.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>And like a practical Petersburg lady who knows how to make the most of time, Anna Mikháylovna sent someone to call her son, and went into the anteroom with him.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Good-by, my dear,&amp;rdquo; said she to the countess who saw her to the door, and added in a whisper so that her son should not hear, &amp;ldquo;Wish me good luck.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Are you going to Count Cyril Vladímirovich, my dear?&amp;rdquo; said the count coming out from the dining hall into the anteroom, and he added: &amp;ldquo;If he is better, ask Pierre to dine with us. He has been to the house, you know, and danced with the children. Be sure to invite him, my dear. We will see how Tarás distinguishes himself today. He says Count Orlóv never gave such a dinner as ours will be!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;My dear Borís,&amp;rdquo; said Princess Anna Mikháylovna to her son as Countess Rostóva&amp;rsquo;s carriage in which they were seated drove over the straw covered street and turned into the wide courtyard of Count Cyril Vladímirovich Bezúkhov&amp;rsquo;s house. &amp;ldquo;My dear Borís,&amp;rdquo; said the mother, drawing her hand from beneath her old mantle and laying it timidly and tenderly on her son&amp;rsquo;s arm, &amp;ldquo;be affectionate and attentive to him. Count Cyril Vladímirovich is your godfather after all, and your future depends on him. Remember that, my dear, and be nice to him, as you so well know how to be.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;If only I knew that anything besides humiliation would come of it...&amp;rdquo; answered her son coldly. &amp;ldquo;But I have promised and will do it for your sake.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Although the hall porter saw someone&amp;rsquo;s carriage standing at the entrance, after scrutinizing the mother and son (who without asking to be announced had passed straight through the glass porch between the rows of statues in niches) and looking significantly at the lady&amp;rsquo;s old cloak, he asked whether they wanted the count or the princesses, and, hearing that they wished to see the count, said his excellency was worse today, and that his excellency was not receiving anyone.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;We may as well go back,&amp;rdquo; said the son in French.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;My dear!&amp;rdquo; exclaimed his mother imploringly, again laying her hand on his arm as if that touch might soothe or rouse him.</p>
    <p>Borís said no more, but looked inquiringly at his mother without taking off his cloak.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;My friend,&amp;rdquo; said Anna Mikháylovna in gentle tones, addressing the hall porter, &amp;ldquo;I know Count Cyril Vladímirovich is very ill... that&amp;rsquo;s why I have come... I am a relation. I shall not disturb him, my friend... I only need see Prince Vasíli Sergéevich: he is staying here, is he not? Please announce me.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The hall porter sullenly pulled a bell that rang upstairs, and turned away.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Princess Drubetskáya to see Prince Vasíli Sergéevich,&amp;rdquo; he called to a footman dressed in knee breeches, shoes, and a swallow-tail coat, who ran downstairs and looked over from the halfway landing.</p>
    <p>The mother smoothed the folds of her dyed silk dress before a large Venetian mirror in the wall, and in her trodden-down shoes briskly ascended the carpeted stairs.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;My dear,&amp;rdquo; she said to her son, once more stimulating him by a touch, &amp;ldquo;you promised me!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The son, lowering his eyes, followed her quietly.</p>
    <p>They entered the large hall, from which one of the doors led to the apartments assigned to Prince Vasíli.</p>
    <p>Just as the mother and son, having reached the middle of the hall, were about to ask their way of an elderly footman who had sprung up as they entered, the bronze handle of one of the doors turned and Prince Vasíli came out&amp;mdash;wearing a velvet coat with a single star on his breast, as was his custom when at home&amp;mdash;taking leave of a good-looking, dark-haired man. This was the celebrated Petersburg doctor, Lorrain.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Then it is certain?&amp;rdquo; said the prince.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Prince, <i>humanum est errare</i>, * but...&amp;rdquo; replied the doctor, swallowing his <i>r</i>&amp;rsquo;s, and pronouncing the Latin words with a French accent.</p>
    <pre class="testable">* To err is human.</pre>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Very well, very well...&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Seeing Anna Mikháylovna and her son, Prince Vasíli dismissed the doctor with a bow and approached them silently and with a look of inquiry. The son noticed that an expression of profound sorrow suddenly clouded his mother&amp;rsquo;s face, and he smiled slightly.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Ah, Prince! In what sad circumstances we meet again! And how is our dear invalid?&amp;rdquo; said she, as though unaware of the cold offensive look fixed on her.</p>
    <p>Prince Vasíli stared at her and at Borís questioningly and perplexed. Borís bowed politely. Prince Vasíli without acknowledging the bow turned to Anna Mikháylovna, answering her query by a movement of the head and lips indicating very little hope for the patient.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Is it possible?&amp;rdquo; exclaimed Anna Mikháylovna. &amp;ldquo;Oh, how awful! It is terrible to think.... This is my son,&amp;rdquo; she added, indicating Borís. &amp;ldquo;He wanted to thank you himself.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Borís bowed again politely.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Believe me, Prince, a mother&amp;rsquo;s heart will never forget what you have done for us.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I am glad I was able to do you a service, my dear Anna Mikháylovna,&amp;rdquo; said Prince Vasíli, arranging his lace frill, and in tone and manner, here in Moscow to Anna Mikháylovna whom he had placed under an obligation, assuming an air of much greater importance than he had done in Petersburg at Anna Schérer&amp;rsquo;s reception.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Try to serve well and show yourself worthy,&amp;rdquo; added he, addressing Borís with severity. &amp;ldquo;I am glad.... Are you here on leave?&amp;rdquo; he went on in his usual tone of indifference.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I am awaiting orders to join my new regiment, your excellency,&amp;rdquo; replied Borís, betraying neither annoyance at the prince&amp;rsquo;s brusque manner nor a desire to enter into conversation, but speaking so quietly and respectfully that the prince gave him a searching glance.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Are you living with your mother?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I am living at Countess Rostóva&amp;rsquo;s,&amp;rdquo; replied Borís, again adding, &amp;ldquo;your excellency.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;That is, with Ilyá Rostóv who married Nataly Shinshiná,&amp;rdquo; said Anna Mikháylovna.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I know, I know,&amp;rdquo; answered Prince Vasíli in his monotonous voice. &amp;ldquo;I never could understand how Nataly made up her mind to marry that unlicked bear! A perfectly absurd and stupid fellow, and a gambler too, I am told.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;But a very kind man, Prince,&amp;rdquo; said Anna Mikháylovna with a pathetic smile, as though she too knew that Count Rostóv deserved this censure, but asked him not to be too hard on the poor old man. &amp;ldquo;What do the doctors say?&amp;rdquo; asked the princess after a pause, her worn face again expressing deep sorrow.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;They give little hope,&amp;rdquo; replied the prince.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;And I should so like to thank <i>Uncle</i> once for all his kindness to me and Borís. He is his godson,&amp;rdquo; she added, her tone suggesting that this fact ought to give Prince Vasíli much satisfaction.</p>
    <p>Prince Vasíli became thoughtful and frowned. Anna Mikháylovna saw that he was afraid of finding in her a rival for Count Bezúkhov&amp;rsquo;s fortune, and hastened to reassure him.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;If it were not for my sincere affection and devotion to <i>Uncle</i>,&amp;rdquo; said she, uttering the word with peculiar assurance and unconcern, &amp;ldquo;I know his character: noble, upright ... but you see he has no one with him except the young princesses.... They are still young....&amp;rdquo; She bent her head and continued in a whisper: &amp;ldquo;Has he performed his final duty, Prince? How priceless are those last moments! It can make things no worse, and it is absolutely necessary to prepare him if he is so ill. We women, Prince,&amp;rdquo; and she smiled tenderly, &amp;ldquo;always know how to say these things. I absolutely must see him, however painful it may be for me. I am used to suffering.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Evidently the prince understood her, and also understood, as he had done at Anna Pávlovna&amp;rsquo;s, that it would be difficult to get rid of Anna Mikháylovna.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Would not such a meeting be too trying for him, dear Anna Mikháylovna?&amp;rdquo; said he. &amp;ldquo;Let us wait until evening. The doctors are expecting a crisis.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;But one cannot delay, Prince, at such a moment! Consider that the welfare of his soul is at stake. Ah, it is awful: the duties of a Christian...&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>A door of one of the inner rooms opened and one of the princesses, the count&amp;rsquo;s niece, entered with a cold, stern face. The length of her body was strikingly out of proportion to her short legs. Prince Vasíli turned to her.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well, how is he?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Still the same; but what can you expect, this noise...&amp;rdquo; said the princess, looking at Anna Mikháylovna as at a stranger.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Ah, my dear, I hardly knew you,&amp;rdquo; said Anna Mikháylovna with a happy smile, ambling lightly up to the count&amp;rsquo;s niece. &amp;ldquo;I have come, and am at your service to help you nurse <i>my uncle</i>. I imagine what you have gone through,&amp;rdquo; and she sympathetically turned up her eyes.</p>
    <p>The princess gave no reply and did not even smile, but left the room as Anna Mikháylovna took off her gloves and, occupying the position she had conquered, settled down in an armchair, inviting Prince Vasíli to take a seat beside her.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Borís,&amp;rdquo; she said to her son with a smile, &amp;ldquo;I shall go in to see the count, my uncle; but you, my dear, had better go to Pierre meanwhile and don&amp;rsquo;t forget to give him the Rostóvs&amp;rsquo; invitation. They ask him to dinner. I suppose he won&amp;rsquo;t go?&amp;rdquo; she continued, turning to the prince.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;On the contrary,&amp;rdquo; replied the prince, who had plainly become depressed, &amp;ldquo;I shall be only too glad if you relieve me of that young man.... Here he is, and the count has not once asked for him.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>He shrugged his shoulders. A footman conducted Borís down one flight of stairs and up another, to Pierre&amp;rsquo;s rooms.</p>
    <h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
    <p>Pierre, after all, had not managed to choose a career for himself in Petersburg, and had been expelled from there for riotous conduct and sent to Moscow. The story told about him at Count Rostóv&amp;rsquo;s was true. Pierre had taken part in tying a policeman to a bear. He had now been for some days in Moscow and was staying as usual at his father&amp;rsquo;s house. Though he expected that the story of his escapade would be already known in Moscow and that the ladies about his father&amp;mdash;who were never favorably disposed toward him&amp;mdash;would have used it to turn the count against him, he nevertheless on the day of his arrival went to his father&amp;rsquo;s part of the house. Entering the drawing room, where the princesses spent most of their time, he greeted the ladies, two of whom were sitting at embroidery frames while a third read aloud. It was the eldest who was reading&amp;mdash;the one who had met Anna Mikháylovna. The two younger ones were embroidering: both were rosy and pretty and they differed only in that one had a little mole on her lip which made her much prettier. Pierre was received as if he were a corpse or a leper. The eldest princess paused in her reading and silently stared at him with frightened eyes; the second assumed precisely the same expression; while the youngest, the one with the mole, who was of a cheerful and lively disposition, bent over her frame to hide a smile probably evoked by the amusing scene she foresaw. She drew her wool down through the canvas and, scarcely able to refrain from laughing, stooped as if trying to make out the pattern.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;How do you do, cousin?&amp;rdquo; said Pierre. &amp;ldquo;You don&amp;rsquo;t recognize me?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I recognize you only too well, too well.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;How is the count? Can I see him?&amp;rdquo; asked Pierre, awkwardly as usual, but unabashed.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;The count is suffering physically and mentally, and apparently you have done your best to increase his mental sufferings.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Can I see the count?&amp;rdquo; Pierre again asked.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Hm.... If you wish to kill him, to kill him outright, you can see him... Olga, go and see whether Uncle&amp;rsquo;s beef tea is ready&amp;mdash;it is almost time,&amp;rdquo; she added, giving Pierre to understand that they were busy, and busy making his father comfortable, while evidently he, Pierre, was only busy causing him annoyance.</p>
    <p>Olga went out. Pierre stood looking at the sisters; then he bowed and said: &amp;ldquo;Then I will go to my rooms. You will let me know when I can see him.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>And he left the room, followed by the low but ringing laughter of the sister with the mole.</p>
    <p>Next day Prince Vasíli had arrived and settled in the count&amp;rsquo;s house. He sent for Pierre and said to him: &amp;ldquo;My dear fellow, if you are going to behave here as you did in Petersburg, you will end very badly; that is all I have to say to you. The count is very, very ill, and you must not see him at all.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Since then Pierre had not been disturbed and had spent the whole time in his rooms upstairs.</p>
    <p>When Borís appeared at his door Pierre was pacing up and down his room, stopping occasionally at a corner to make menacing gestures at the wall, as if running a sword through an invisible foe, and glaring savagely over his spectacles, and then again resuming his walk, muttering indistinct words, shrugging his shoulders and gesticulating.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;England is done for,&amp;rdquo; said he, scowling and pointing his finger at someone unseen. &amp;ldquo;Mr. Pitt, as a traitor to the nation and to the rights of man, is sentenced to...&amp;rdquo; But before Pierre&amp;mdash;who at that moment imagined himself to be Napoleon in person and to have just effected the dangerous crossing of the Straits of Dover and captured London&amp;mdash;could pronounce Pitt&amp;rsquo;s sentence, he saw a well-built and handsome young officer entering his room. Pierre paused. He had left Moscow when Borís was a boy of fourteen, and had quite forgotten him, but in his usual impulsive and hearty way he took Borís by the hand with a friendly smile.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Do you remember me?&amp;rdquo; asked Borís quietly with a pleasant smile. &amp;ldquo;I have come with my mother to see the count, but it seems he is not well.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Yes, it seems he is ill. People are always disturbing him,&amp;rdquo; answered Pierre, trying to remember who this young man was.</p>
    <p>Borís felt that Pierre did not recognize him but did not consider it necessary to introduce himself, and without experiencing the least embarrassment looked Pierre straight in the face.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Count Rostóv asks you to come to dinner today,&amp;rdquo; said he, after a considerable pause which made Pierre feel uncomfortable.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Ah, Count Rostóv!&amp;rdquo; exclaimed Pierre joyfully. &amp;ldquo;Then you are his son, Ilyá? Only fancy, I didn&amp;rsquo;t know you at first. Do you remember how we went to the Sparrow Hills with Madame Jacquot?... It&amp;rsquo;s such an age...&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;You are mistaken,&amp;rdquo; said Borís deliberately, with a bold and slightly sarcastic smile. &amp;ldquo;I am Borís, son of Princess Anna Mikháylovna Drubetskáya. Rostóv, the father, is Ilyá, and his son is Nicholas. I never knew any Madame Jacquot.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Pierre shook his head and arms as if attacked by mosquitoes or bees.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Oh dear, what am I thinking about? I&amp;rsquo;ve mixed everything up. One has so many relatives in Moscow! So you are Borís? Of course. Well, now we know where we are. And what do you think of the Boulogne expedition? The English will come off badly, you know, if Napoleon gets across the Channel. I think the expedition is quite feasible. If only Villeneuve doesn&amp;rsquo;t make a mess of things!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Borís knew nothing about the Boulogne expedition; he did not read the papers and it was the first time he had heard Villeneuve&amp;rsquo;s name.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;We here in Moscow are more occupied with dinner parties and scandal than with politics,&amp;rdquo; said he in his quiet ironical tone. &amp;ldquo;I know nothing about it and have not thought about it. Moscow is chiefly busy with gossip,&amp;rdquo; he continued. &amp;ldquo;Just now they are talking about you and your father.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Pierre smiled in his good-natured way as if afraid for his companion&amp;rsquo;s sake that the latter might say something he would afterwards regret. But Borís spoke distinctly, clearly, and dryly, looking straight into Pierre&amp;rsquo;s eyes.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Moscow has nothing else to do but gossip,&amp;rdquo; Borís went on. &amp;ldquo;Everybody is wondering to whom the count will leave his fortune, though he may perhaps outlive us all, as I sincerely hope he will...&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Yes, it is all very horrid,&amp;rdquo; interrupted Pierre, &amp;ldquo;very horrid.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Pierre was still afraid that this officer might inadvertently say something disconcerting to himself.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;And it must seem to you,&amp;rdquo; said Borís flushing slightly, but not changing his tone or attitude, &amp;ldquo;it must seem to you that everyone is trying to get something out of the rich man?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;So it does,&amp;rdquo; thought Pierre.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;But I just wish to say, to avoid misunderstandings, that you are quite mistaken if you reckon me or my mother among such people. We are very poor, but for my own part at any rate, for the very reason that your father is rich, I don&amp;rsquo;t regard myself as a relation of his, and neither I nor my mother would ever ask or take anything from him.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>For a long time Pierre could not understand, but when he did, he jumped up from the sofa, seized Borís under the elbow in his quick, clumsy way, and, blushing far more than Borís, began to speak with a feeling of mingled shame and vexation.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well, this is strange! Do you suppose I... who could think?... I know very well...&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>But Borís again interrupted him.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I am glad I have spoken out fully. Perhaps you did not like it? You must excuse me,&amp;rdquo; said he, putting Pierre at ease instead of being put at ease by him, &amp;ldquo;but I hope I have not offended you. I always make it a rule to speak out... Well, what answer am I to take? Will you come to dinner at the Rostóvs&amp;rsquo;?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>And Borís, having apparently relieved himself of an onerous duty and extricated himself from an awkward situation and placed another in it, became quite pleasant again.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;No, but I say,&amp;rdquo; said Pierre, calming down, &amp;ldquo;you are a wonderful fellow! What you have just said is good, very good. Of course you don&amp;rsquo;t know me. We have not met for such a long time... not since we were children. You might think that I... I understand, quite understand. I could not have done it myself, I should not have had the courage, but it&amp;rsquo;s splendid. I am very glad to have made your acquaintance. It&amp;rsquo;s queer,&amp;rdquo; he added after a pause, &amp;ldquo;that you should have suspected me!&amp;rdquo; He began to laugh. &amp;ldquo;Well, what of it! I hope we&amp;rsquo;ll get better acquainted,&amp;rdquo; and he pressed Borís&amp;rsquo; hand. &amp;ldquo;Do you know, I have not once been in to see the count. He has not sent for me.... I am sorry for him as a man, but what can one do?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;And so you think Napoleon will manage to get an army across?&amp;rdquo; asked Borís with a smile.</p>
    <p>Pierre saw that Borís wished to change the subject, and being of the same mind he began explaining the advantages and disadvantages of the Boulogne expedition.</p>
    <p>A footman came in to summon Borís&amp;mdash;the princess was going. Pierre, in order to make Borís&amp;rsquo; better acquaintance, promised to come to dinner, and warmly pressing his hand looked affectionately over his spectacles into Borís&amp;rsquo; eyes. After he had gone Pierre continued pacing up and down the room for a long time, no longer piercing an imaginary foe with his imaginary sword, but smiling at the remembrance of that pleasant, intelligent, and resolute young man.</p>
    <p>As often happens in early youth, especially to one who leads a lonely life, he felt an unaccountable tenderness for this young man and made up his mind that they would be friends.</p>
    <p>Prince Vasíli saw the princess off. She held a handkerchief to her eyes and her face was tearful.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;It is dreadful, dreadful!&amp;rdquo; she was saying, &amp;ldquo;but cost me what it may I shall do my duty. I will come and spend the night. He must not be left like this. Every moment is precious. I can&amp;rsquo;t think why his nieces put it off. Perhaps God will help me to find a way to prepare him!... Adieu, Prince! May God support you...&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p><i>&amp;ldquo;Adieu, ma bonne,&amp;rdquo;</i> answered Prince Vasíli turning away from her.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Oh, he is in a dreadful state,&amp;rdquo; said the mother to her son when they were in the carriage. &amp;ldquo;He hardly recognizes anybody.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t understand, Mamma&amp;mdash;what is his attitude to Pierre?&amp;rdquo; asked the son.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;The will will show that, my dear; our fate also depends on it.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;But why do you expect that he will leave us anything?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Ah, my dear! He is so rich, and we are so poor!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well, that is hardly a sufficient reason, Mamma...&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Oh, Heaven! How ill he is!&amp;rdquo; exclaimed the mother.</p>
    <h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
    <p>After Anna Mikháylovna had driven off with her son to visit Count Cyril Vladímirovich Bezúkhov, Countess Rostóva sat for a long time all alone applying her handkerchief to her eyes. At last she rang.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;What is the matter with you, my dear?&amp;rdquo; she said crossly to the maid who kept her waiting some minutes. &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t you wish to serve me? Then I&amp;rsquo;ll find you another place.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The countess was upset by her friend&amp;rsquo;s sorrow and humiliating poverty, and was therefore out of sorts, a state of mind which with her always found expression in calling her maid &amp;ldquo;my dear&amp;rdquo; and speaking to her with exaggerated politeness.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I am very sorry, ma&amp;rsquo;am,&amp;rdquo; answered the maid.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Ask the count to come to me.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The count came waddling in to see his wife with a rather guilty look as usual.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well, little countess? What a <i>sauté</i> of game <i>au madère</i> we are to have, my dear! I tasted it. The thousand rubles I paid for Tarás were not ill-spent. He is worth it!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>He sat down by his wife, his elbows on his knees and his hands ruffling his gray hair.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;What are your commands, little countess?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;You see, my dear... What&amp;rsquo;s that mess?&amp;rdquo; she said, pointing to his waistcoat. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s the <i>sauté</i>, most likely,&amp;rdquo; she added with a smile. &amp;ldquo;Well, you see, Count, I want some money.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Her face became sad.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Oh, little countess!&amp;rdquo; ... and the count began bustling to get out his pocketbook.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I want a great deal, Count! I want five hundred rubles,&amp;rdquo; and taking out her cambric handkerchief she began wiping her husband&amp;rsquo;s waistcoat.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Yes, immediately, immediately! Hey, who&amp;rsquo;s there?&amp;rdquo; he called out in a tone only used by persons who are certain that those they call will rush to obey the summons. &amp;ldquo;Send Dmítri to me!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Dmítri, a man of good family who had been brought up in the count&amp;rsquo;s house and now managed all his affairs, stepped softly into the room.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;This is what I want, my dear fellow,&amp;rdquo; said the count to the deferential young man who had entered. &amp;ldquo;Bring me...&amp;rdquo; he reflected a moment, &amp;ldquo;yes, bring me seven hundred rubles, yes! But mind, don&amp;rsquo;t bring me such tattered and dirty notes as last time, but nice clean ones for the countess.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Yes, Dmítri, clean ones, please,&amp;rdquo; said the countess, sighing deeply.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;When would you like them, your excellency?&amp;rdquo; asked Dmítri. &amp;ldquo;Allow me to inform you... But, don&amp;rsquo;t be uneasy,&amp;rdquo; he added, noticing that the count was beginning to breathe heavily and quickly which was always a sign of approaching anger. &amp;ldquo;I was forgetting... Do you wish it brought at once?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Yes, yes; just so! Bring it. Give it to the countess.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;What a treasure that Dmítri is,&amp;rdquo; added the count with a smile when the young man had departed. &amp;ldquo;There is never any &amp;lsquo;impossible&amp;rsquo; with him. That&amp;rsquo;s a thing I hate! Everything is possible.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Ah, money, Count, money! How much sorrow it causes in the world,&amp;rdquo; said the countess. &amp;ldquo;But I am in great need of this sum.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;You, my little countess, are a notorious spendthrift,&amp;rdquo; said the count, and having kissed his wife&amp;rsquo;s hand he went back to his study.</p>
    <p>When Anna Mikháylovna returned from Count Bezúkhov&amp;rsquo;s the money, all in clean notes, was lying ready under a handkerchief on the countess&amp;rsquo; little table, and Anna Mikháylovna noticed that something was agitating her.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well, my dear?&amp;rdquo; asked the countess.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Oh, what a terrible state he is in! One would not know him, he is so ill! I was only there a few moments and hardly said a word...&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Annette, for heaven&amp;rsquo;s sake don&amp;rsquo;t refuse me,&amp;rdquo; the countess began, with a blush that looked very strange on her thin, dignified, elderly face, and she took the money from under the handkerchief.</p>
    <p>Anna Mikháylovna instantly guessed her intention and stooped to be ready to embrace the countess at the appropriate moment.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;This is for Borís from me, for his outfit.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Anna Mikháylovna was already embracing her and weeping. The countess wept too. They wept because they were friends, and because they were kindhearted, and because they&amp;mdash;friends from childhood&amp;mdash;had to think about such a base thing as money, and because their youth was over.... But those tears were pleasant to them both.</p>
    <h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
    <p>Countess Rostóva, with her daughters and a large number of guests, was already seated in the drawing room. The count took the gentlemen into his study and showed them his choice collection of Turkish pipes. From time to time he went out to ask: &amp;ldquo;Hasn&amp;rsquo;t she come yet?&amp;rdquo; They were expecting Márya Dmítrievna Akhrosímova, known in society as <i>le terrible dragon</i>, a lady distinguished not for wealth or rank, but for common sense and frank plainness of speech. Márya Dmítrievna was known to the Imperial family as well as to all Moscow and Petersburg, and both cities wondered at her, laughed privately at her rudenesses, and told good stories about her, while none the less all without exception respected and feared her.</p>
    <p>In the count&amp;rsquo;s room, which was full of tobacco smoke, they talked of the war that had been announced in a manifesto, and about the recruiting. None of them had yet seen the manifesto, but they all knew it had appeared. The count sat on the sofa between two guests who were smoking and talking. He neither smoked nor talked, but bending his head first to one side and then to the other watched the smokers with evident pleasure and listened to the conversation of his two neighbors, whom he egged on against each other.</p>
    <p>One of them was a sallow, clean-shaven civilian with a thin and wrinkled face, already growing old, though he was dressed like a most fashionable young man. He sat with his legs up on the sofa as if quite at home and, having stuck an amber mouthpiece far into his mouth, was inhaling the smoke spasmodically and screwing up his eyes. This was an old bachelor, Shinshín, a cousin of the countess&amp;rsquo;, a man with &amp;ldquo;a sharp tongue&amp;rdquo; as they said in Moscow society. He seemed to be condescending to his companion. The latter, a fresh, rosy officer of the Guards, irreproachably washed, brushed, and buttoned, held his pipe in the middle of his mouth and with red lips gently inhaled the smoke, letting it escape from his handsome mouth in rings. This was Lieutenant Berg, an officer in the Semënov regiment with whom Borís was to travel to join the army, and about whom Natásha had teased her elder sister Véra, speaking of Berg as her &amp;ldquo;intended.&amp;rdquo; The count sat between them and listened attentively. His favorite occupation when not playing boston, a card game he was very fond of, was that of listener, especially when he succeeded in setting two loquacious talkers at one another.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well, then, old chap, <i>mon très honorable</i> Alphonse Kárlovich,&amp;rdquo; said Shinshín, laughing ironically and mixing the most ordinary Russian expressions with the choicest French phrases&amp;mdash;which was a peculiarity of his speech. &amp;ldquo;<i>Vous comptez vous faire des rentes sur l&amp;rsquo;état</i>; * you want to make something out of your company?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <pre class="testable">* You expect to make an income out of the government.</pre>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;No, Peter Nikoláevich; I only want to show that in the cavalry the advantages are far less than in the infantry. Just consider my own position now, Peter Nikoláevich...&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Berg always spoke quietly, politely, and with great precision. His conversation always related entirely to himself; he would remain calm and silent when the talk related to any topic that had no direct bearing on himself. He could remain silent for hours without being at all put out of countenance himself or making others uncomfortable, but as soon as the conversation concerned himself he would begin to talk circumstantially and with evident satisfaction.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Consider my position, Peter Nikoláevich. Were I in the cavalry I should get not more than two hundred rubles every four months, even with the rank of lieutenant; but as it is I receive two hundred and thirty,&amp;rdquo; said he, looking at Shinshín and the count with a joyful, pleasant smile, as if it were obvious to him that his success must always be the chief desire of everyone else.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Besides that, Peter Nikoláevich, by exchanging into the Guards I shall be in a more prominent position,&amp;rdquo; continued Berg, &amp;ldquo;and vacancies occur much more frequently in the Foot Guards. Then just think what can be done with two hundred and thirty rubles! I even manage to put a little aside and to send something to my father,&amp;rdquo; he went on, emitting a smoke ring.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;<i>La balance y est</i>... * A German knows how to skin a flint, as the proverb says,&amp;rdquo; remarked Shinshín, moving his pipe to the other side of his mouth and winking at the count.</p>
    <pre class="testable">* So that squares matters.</pre>
    <p>The count burst out laughing. The other guests seeing that Shinshín was talking came up to listen. Berg, oblivious of irony or indifference, continued to explain how by exchanging into the Guards he had already gained a step on his old comrades of the Cadet Corps; how in wartime the company commander might get killed and he, as senior in the company, might easily succeed to the post; how popular he was with everyone in the regiment, and how satisfied his father was with him. Berg evidently enjoyed narrating all this, and did not seem to suspect that others, too, might have their own interests. But all he said was so prettily sedate, and the naïveté of his youthful egotism was so obvious, that he disarmed his hearers.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well, my boy, you&amp;rsquo;ll get along wherever you go&amp;mdash;foot or horse&amp;mdash;that I&amp;rsquo;ll warrant,&amp;rdquo; said Shinshín, patting him on the shoulder and taking his feet off the sofa.</p>
    <p>Berg smiled joyously. The count, followed by his guests, went into the drawing room.</p>
    <p>It was just the moment before a big dinner when the assembled guests, expecting the summons to <i>zakúska</i>, * avoid engaging in any long conversation but think it necessary to move about and talk, in order to show that they are not at all impatient for their food. The host and hostess look toward the door, and now and then glance at one another, and the visitors try to guess from these glances who, or what, they are waiting for&amp;mdash;some important relation who has not yet arrived, or a dish that is not yet ready.</p>
    <pre class="testable">* Hors d&amp;rsquo;oeuvres.</pre>
    <p>Pierre had come just at dinnertime and was sitting awkwardly in the middle of the drawing room on the first chair he had come across, blocking the way for everyone. The countess tried to make him talk, but he went on naïvely looking around through his spectacles as if in search of somebody and answered all her questions in monosyllables. He was in the way and was the only one who did not notice the fact. Most of the guests, knowing of the affair with the bear, looked with curiosity at this big, stout, quiet man, wondering how such a clumsy, modest fellow could have played such a prank on a policeman.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;You have only lately arrived?&amp;rdquo; the countess asked him.</p>
    <p><i>&amp;ldquo;Oui, madame,&amp;rdquo;</i> replied he, looking around him.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;You have not yet seen my husband?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p><i>&amp;ldquo;Non, madame.&amp;rdquo;</i> He smiled quite inappropriately.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;You have been in Paris recently, I believe? I suppose it&amp;rsquo;s very interesting.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Very interesting.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The countess exchanged glances with Anna Mikháylovna. The latter understood that she was being asked to entertain this young man, and sitting down beside him she began to speak about his father; but he answered her, as he had the countess, only in monosyllables. The other guests were all conversing with one another. &amp;ldquo;The Razumóvskis... It was charming... You are very kind... Countess Apráksina...&amp;rdquo; was heard on all sides. The countess rose and went into the ballroom.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Márya Dmítrievna?&amp;rdquo; came her voice from there.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Herself,&amp;rdquo; came the answer in a rough voice, and Márya Dmítrievna entered the room.</p>
    <p>All the unmarried ladies and even the married ones except the very oldest rose. Márya Dmítrievna paused at the door. Tall and stout, holding high her fifty-year-old head with its gray curls, she stood surveying the guests, and leisurely arranged her wide sleeves as if rolling them up. Márya Dmítrievna always spoke in Russian.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Health and happiness to her whose name day we are keeping and to her children,&amp;rdquo; she said, in her loud, full-toned voice which drowned all others. &amp;ldquo;Well, you old sinner,&amp;rdquo; she went on, turning to the count who was kissing her hand, &amp;ldquo;you&amp;rsquo;re feeling dull in Moscow, I daresay? Nowhere to hunt with your dogs? But what is to be done, old man? Just see how these nestlings are growing up,&amp;rdquo; and she pointed to the girls. &amp;ldquo;You must look for husbands for them whether you like it or not....&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well,&amp;rdquo; said she, &amp;ldquo;how&amp;rsquo;s my Cossack?&amp;rdquo; (Márya Dmítrievna always called Natásha a Cossack) and she stroked the child&amp;rsquo;s arm as she came up fearless and gay to kiss her hand. &amp;ldquo;I know she&amp;rsquo;s a scamp of a girl, but I like her.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>She took a pair of pear-shaped ruby earrings from her huge reticule and, having given them to the rosy Natásha, who beamed with the pleasure of her saint&amp;rsquo;s-day fete, turned away at once and addressed herself to Pierre.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Eh, eh, friend! Come here a bit,&amp;rdquo; said she, assuming a soft high tone of voice. &amp;ldquo;Come here, my friend...&amp;rdquo; and she ominously tucked up her sleeves still higher. Pierre approached, looking at her in a childlike way through his spectacles.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Come nearer, come nearer, friend! I used to be the only one to tell your father the truth when he was in favor, and in your case it&amp;rsquo;s my evident duty.&amp;rdquo; She paused. All were silent, expectant of what was to follow, for this was clearly only a prelude.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;A fine lad! My word! A fine lad!... His father lies on his deathbed and he amuses himself setting a policeman astride a bear! For shame, sir, for shame! It would be better if you went to the war.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>She turned away and gave her hand to the count, who could hardly keep from laughing.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well, I suppose it is time we were at table?&amp;rdquo; said Márya Dmítrievna.</p>
    <p>The count went in first with Márya Dmítrievna, the countess followed on the arm of a colonel of hussars, a man of importance to them because Nicholas was to go with him to the regiment; then came Anna Mikháylovna with Shinshín. Berg gave his arm to Véra. The smiling Julie Karágina went in with Nicholas. After them other couples followed, filling the whole dining hall, and last of all the children, tutors, and governesses followed singly. The footmen began moving about, chairs scraped, the band struck up in the gallery, and the guests settled down in their places. Then the strains of the count&amp;rsquo;s household band were replaced by the clatter of knives and forks, the voices of visitors, and the soft steps of the footmen. At one end of the table sat the countess with Márya Dmítrievna on her right and Anna Mikháylovna on her left, the other lady visitors were farther down. At the other end sat the count, with the hussar colonel on his left and Shinshín and the other male visitors on his right. Midway down the long table on one side sat the grown-up young people: Véra beside Berg, and Pierre beside Borís; and on the other side, the children, tutors, and governesses. From behind the crystal decanters and fruit vases, the count kept glancing at his wife and her tall cap with its light-blue ribbons, and busily filled his neighbors&amp;rsquo; glasses, not neglecting his own. The countess in turn, without omitting her duties as hostess, threw significant glances from behind the pineapples at her husband whose face and bald head seemed by their redness to contrast more than usual with his gray hair. At the ladies&amp;rsquo; end an even chatter of voices was heard all the time, at the men&amp;rsquo;s end the voices sounded louder and louder, especially that of the colonel of hussars who, growing more and more flushed, ate and drank so much that the count held him up as a pattern to the other guests. Berg with tender smiles was saying to Véra that love is not an earthly but a heavenly feeling. Borís was telling his new friend Pierre who the guests were and exchanging glances with Natásha, who was sitting opposite. Pierre spoke little but examined the new faces, and ate a great deal. Of the two soups he chose turtle with savory patties and went on to the game without omitting a single dish or one of the wines. These latter the butler thrust mysteriously forward, wrapped in a napkin, from behind the next man&amp;rsquo;s shoulders and whispered: &amp;ldquo;Dry Madeira&amp;rdquo;... &amp;ldquo;Hungarian&amp;rdquo;... or &amp;ldquo;Rhine wine&amp;rdquo; as the case might be. Of the four crystal glasses engraved with the count&amp;rsquo;s monogram that stood before his plate, Pierre held out one at random and drank with enjoyment, gazing with ever-increasing amiability at the other guests. Natásha, who sat opposite, was looking at Borís as girls of thirteen look at the boy they are in love with and have just kissed for the first time. Sometimes that same look fell on Pierre, and that funny lively little girl&amp;rsquo;s look made him inclined to laugh without knowing why.</p>
    <p>Nicholas sat at some distance from Sónya, beside Julie Karágina, to whom he was again talking with the same involuntary smile. Sónya wore a company smile but was evidently tormented by jealousy; now she turned pale, now blushed and strained every nerve to overhear what Nicholas and Julie were saying to one another. The governess kept looking round uneasily as if preparing to resent any slight that might be put upon the children. The German tutor was trying to remember all the dishes, wines, and kinds of dessert, in order to send a full description of the dinner to his people in Germany; and he felt greatly offended when the butler with a bottle wrapped in a napkin passed him by. He frowned, trying to appear as if he did not want any of that wine, but was mortified because no one would understand that it was not to quench his thirst or from greediness that he wanted it, but simply from a conscientious desire for knowledge.</p>
    <h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
    <p>At the men&amp;rsquo;s end of the table the talk grew more and more animated. The colonel told them that the declaration of war had already appeared in Petersburg and that a copy, which he had himself seen, had that day been forwarded by courier to the commander in chief.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;And why the deuce are we going to fight Bonaparte?&amp;rdquo; remarked Shinshín. &amp;ldquo;He has stopped Austria&amp;rsquo;s cackle and I fear it will be our turn next.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The colonel was a stout, tall, plethoric German, evidently devoted to the service and patriotically Russian. He resented Shinshín&amp;rsquo;s remark.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;It is for the reasson, my goot sir,&amp;rdquo; said he, speaking with a German accent, &amp;ldquo;for the reasson zat ze Emperor knows zat. He declares in ze manifessto zat he cannot fiew wiz indifference ze danger vreatening Russia and zat ze safety and dignity of ze Empire as vell as ze sanctity of its <i>alliances</i>...&amp;rdquo; he spoke this last word with particular emphasis as if in it lay the gist of the matter.</p>
    <p>Then with the unerring official memory that characterized him he repeated from the opening words of the manifesto:</p>
    <p>... <i>and the wish, which constitutes the Emperor&amp;rsquo;s sole and absolute aim&amp;mdash;to establish peace in Europe on firm foundations&amp;mdash;has now decided him to despatch part of the army abroad and to create a new condition for the attainment of that purpose</i>.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Zat, my dear sir, is vy...&amp;rdquo; he concluded, drinking a tumbler of wine with dignity and looking to the count for approval.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;<i>Connaissez-vous le Proverbe:</i>* &amp;lsquo;Jerome, Jerome, do not roam, but turn spindles at home!&amp;rsquo;?&amp;rdquo; said Shinshín, puckering his brows and smiling. &amp;ldquo;<i>Cela nous convient à merveille</i>.*(2) Suvórov now&amp;mdash;he knew what he was about; yet they beat him <i>à plate couture</i>,*(3) and where are we to find Suvórovs now? <i>Je vous demande un peu</i>,&amp;rdquo; *(4) said he, continually changing from French to Russian.</p>
    <pre class="testable">*Do you know the proverb? *(2) That suits us down to the ground. *(3) Hollow. *(4) I just ask you that.</pre>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Ve must vight to the last tr-r-op of our plood!&amp;rdquo; said the colonel, thumping the table; &amp;ldquo;and ve must tie for our Emperor, and zen all vill pe vell. And ve must discuss it as little as po-o-ossible&amp;rdquo;... he dwelt particularly on the word <i>possible</i>... &amp;ldquo;as po-o-ossible,&amp;rdquo; he ended, again turning to the count. &amp;ldquo;Zat is how ve old hussars look at it, and zere&amp;rsquo;s an end of it! And how do you, a young man and a young hussar, how do you judge of it?&amp;rdquo; he added, addressing Nicholas, who when he heard that the war was being discussed had turned from his partner with eyes and ears intent on the colonel.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I am quite of your opinion,&amp;rdquo; replied Nicholas, flaming up, turning his plate round and moving his wineglasses about with as much decision and desperation as though he were at that moment facing some great danger. &amp;ldquo;I am convinced that we Russians must die or conquer,&amp;rdquo; he concluded, conscious&amp;mdash;as were others&amp;mdash;after the words were uttered that his remarks were too enthusiastic and emphatic for the occasion and were therefore awkward.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;What you said just now was splendid!&amp;rdquo; said his partner Julie.</p>
    <p>Sónya trembled all over and blushed to her ears and behind them and down to her neck and shoulders while Nicholas was speaking.</p>
    <p>Pierre listened to the colonel&amp;rsquo;s speech and nodded approvingly.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s fine,&amp;rdquo; said he.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;The young man&amp;rsquo;s a real hussar!&amp;rdquo; shouted the colonel, again thumping the table.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;What are you making such a noise about over there?&amp;rdquo; Márya Dmítrievna&amp;rsquo;s deep voice suddenly inquired from the other end of the table. &amp;ldquo;What are you thumping the table for?&amp;rdquo; she demanded of the hussar, &amp;ldquo;and why are you exciting yourself? Do you think the French are here?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I am speaking ze truce,&amp;rdquo; replied the hussar with a smile.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s all about the war,&amp;rdquo; the count shouted down the table. &amp;ldquo;You know my son&amp;rsquo;s going, Márya Dmítrievna? My son is going.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I have four sons in the army but still I don&amp;rsquo;t fret. It is all in God&amp;rsquo;s hands. You may die in your bed or God may spare you in a battle,&amp;rdquo; replied Márya Dmítrievna&amp;rsquo;s deep voice, which easily carried the whole length of the table.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s true!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Once more the conversations concentrated, the ladies&amp;rsquo; at the one end and the men&amp;rsquo;s at the other.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;You won&amp;rsquo;t ask,&amp;rdquo; Natásha&amp;rsquo;s little brother was saying; &amp;ldquo;I know you won&amp;rsquo;t ask!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I will,&amp;rdquo; replied Natásha.</p>
    <p>Her face suddenly flushed with reckless and joyous resolution. She half rose, by a glance inviting Pierre, who sat opposite, to listen to what was coming, and turning to her mother:</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Mamma!&amp;rdquo; rang out the clear contralto notes of her childish voice, audible the whole length of the table.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;What is it?&amp;rdquo; asked the countess, startled; but seeing by her daughter&amp;rsquo;s face that it was only mischief, she shook a finger at her sternly with a threatening and forbidding movement of her head.</p>
    <p>The conversation was hushed.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Mamma! What sweets are we going to have?&amp;rdquo; and Natásha&amp;rsquo;s voice sounded still more firm and resolute.</p>
    <p>The countess tried to frown, but could not. Márya Dmítrievna shook her fat finger.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Cossack!&amp;rdquo; she said threateningly.</p>
    <p>Most of the guests, uncertain how to regard this sally, looked at the elders.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;You had better take care!&amp;rdquo; said the countess.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Mamma! What sweets are we going to have?&amp;rdquo; Natásha again cried boldly, with saucy gaiety, confident that her prank would be taken in good part.</p>
    <p>Sónya and fat little Pétya doubled up with laughter.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;You see! I <i>have</i> asked,&amp;rdquo; whispered Natásha to her little brother and to Pierre, glancing at him again.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Ice pudding, but you won&amp;rsquo;t get any,&amp;rdquo; said Márya Dmítrievna.</p>
    <p>Natásha saw there was nothing to be afraid of and so she braved even Márya Dmítrievna.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Márya Dmítrievna! What kind of ice pudding? I don&amp;rsquo;t like ice cream.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Carrot ices.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;No! What kind, Márya Dmítrievna? What kind?&amp;rdquo; she almost screamed; &amp;ldquo;I want to know!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Márya Dmítrievna and the countess burst out laughing, and all the guests joined in. Everyone laughed, not at Márya Dmítrievna&amp;rsquo;s answer but at the incredible boldness and smartness of this little girl who had dared to treat Márya Dmítrievna in this fashion.</p>
    <p>Natásha only desisted when she had been told that there would be pineapple ice. Before the ices, champagne was served round. The band again struck up, the count and countess kissed, and the guests, leaving their seats, went up to &amp;ldquo;congratulate&amp;rdquo; the countess, and reached across the table to clink glasses with the count, with the children, and with one another. Again the footmen rushed about, chairs scraped, and in the same order in which they had entered but with redder faces, the guests returned to the drawing room and to the count&amp;rsquo;s study.</p>
    <h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
    <p>The card tables were drawn out, sets made up for boston, and the count&amp;rsquo;s visitors settled themselves, some in the two drawing rooms, some in the sitting room, some in the library.</p>
    <p>The count, holding his cards fanwise, kept himself with difficulty from dropping into his usual after-dinner nap, and laughed at everything. The young people, at the countess&amp;rsquo; instigation, gathered round the clavichord and harp. Julie by general request played first. After she had played a little air with variations on the harp, she joined the other young ladies in begging Natásha and Nicholas, who were noted for their musical talent, to sing something. Natásha, who was treated as though she were grown up, was evidently very proud of this but at the same time felt shy.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;What shall we sing?&amp;rdquo; she said.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;The Brook,&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo; suggested Nicholas.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well, then, let&amp;rsquo;s be quick. Borís, come here,&amp;rdquo; said Natásha. &amp;ldquo;But where is Sónya?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>She looked round and seeing that her friend was not in the room ran to look for her.</p>
    <p>Running into Sónya&amp;rsquo;s room and not finding her there, Natásha ran to the nursery, but Sónya was not there either. Natásha concluded that she must be on the chest in the passage. The chest in the passage was the place of mourning for the younger female generation in the Rostóv household. And there in fact was Sónya lying face downward on Nurse&amp;rsquo;s dirty feather bed on the top of the chest, crumpling her gauzy pink dress under her, hiding her face with her slender fingers, and sobbing so convulsively that her bare little shoulders shook. Natásha&amp;rsquo;s face, which had been so radiantly happy all that saint&amp;rsquo;s day, suddenly changed: her eyes became fixed, and then a shiver passed down her broad neck and the corners of her mouth drooped.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Sónya! What is it? What is the matter?... Oo... Oo... Oo...!&amp;rdquo; And Natásha&amp;rsquo;s large mouth widened, making her look quite ugly, and she began to wail like a baby without knowing why, except that Sónya was crying. Sónya tried to lift her head to answer but could not, and hid her face still deeper in the bed. Natásha wept, sitting on the blue-striped feather bed and hugging her friend. With an effort Sónya sat up and began wiping her eyes and explaining.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Nicholas is going away in a week&amp;rsquo;s time, his... papers... have come... he told me himself... but still I should not cry,&amp;rdquo; and she showed a paper she held in her hand&amp;mdash;with the verses Nicholas had written, &amp;ldquo;still, I should not cry, but you can&amp;rsquo;t... no one can understand... what a soul he has!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>And she began to cry again because he had such a noble soul.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s all very well for you... I am not envious... I love you and Borís also,&amp;rdquo; she went on, gaining a little strength; &amp;ldquo;he is nice... there are no difficulties in your way.... But Nicholas is my cousin... one would have to... the Metropolitan himself... and even then it can&amp;rsquo;t be done. And besides, if she tells Mamma&amp;rdquo; (Sónya looked upon the countess as her mother and called her so) &amp;ldquo;that I am spoiling Nicholas&amp;rsquo; career and am heartless and ungrateful, while truly... God is my witness,&amp;rdquo; and she made the sign of the cross, &amp;ldquo;I love her so much, and all of you, only Véra... And what for? What have I done to her? I am so grateful to you that I would willingly sacrifice everything, only I have nothing....&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Sónya could not continue, and again hid her face in her hands and in the feather bed. Natásha began consoling her, but her face showed that she understood all the gravity of her friend&amp;rsquo;s trouble.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Sónya,&amp;rdquo; she suddenly exclaimed, as if she had guessed the true reason of her friend&amp;rsquo;s sorrow, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m sure Véra has said something to you since dinner? Hasn&amp;rsquo;t she?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Yes, these verses Nicholas wrote himself and I copied some others, and she found them on my table and said she&amp;rsquo;d show them to Mamma, and that I was ungrateful, and that Mamma would never allow him to marry me, but that he&amp;rsquo;ll marry Julie. You see how he&amp;rsquo;s been with her all day... Natásha, what have I done to deserve it?...&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>And again she began to sob, more bitterly than before. Natásha lifted her up, hugged her, and, smiling through her tears, began comforting her.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Sónya, don&amp;rsquo;t believe her, darling! Don&amp;rsquo;t believe her! Do you remember how we and Nicholas, all three of us, talked in the sitting room after supper? Why, we settled how everything was to be. I don&amp;rsquo;t quite remember how, but don&amp;rsquo;t you remember that it could all be arranged and how nice it all was? There&amp;rsquo;s Uncle Shinshín&amp;rsquo;s brother has married his first cousin. And we are only second cousins, you know. And Borís says it is quite possible. You know I have told him all about it. And he is so clever and so good!&amp;rdquo; said Natásha. &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t you cry, Sónya, dear love, darling Sónya!&amp;rdquo; and she kissed her and laughed. &amp;ldquo;Véra&amp;rsquo;s spiteful; never mind her! And all will come right and she won&amp;rsquo;t say anything to Mamma. Nicholas will tell her himself, and he doesn&amp;rsquo;t care at all for Julie.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Natásha kissed her on the hair.</p>
    <p>Sónya sat up. The little kitten brightened, its eyes shone, and it seemed ready to lift its tail, jump down on its soft paws, and begin playing with the ball of worsted as a kitten should.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Do you think so?... Really? Truly?&amp;rdquo; she said, quickly smoothing her frock and hair.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Really, truly!&amp;rdquo; answered Natásha, pushing in a crisp lock that had strayed from under her friend&amp;rsquo;s plaits.</p>
    <p>Both laughed.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well, let&amp;rsquo;s go and sing &amp;lsquo;The Brook.&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Come along!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Do you know, that fat Pierre who sat opposite me is so funny!&amp;rdquo; said Natásha, stopping suddenly. &amp;ldquo;I feel so happy!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>And she set off at a run along the passage.</p>
    <p>Sónya, shaking off some down which clung to her and tucking away the verses in the bosom of her dress close to her bony little chest, ran after Natásha down the passage into the sitting room with flushed face and light, joyous steps. At the visitors&amp;rsquo; request the young people sang the quartette, &amp;ldquo;The Brook,&amp;rdquo; with which everyone was delighted. Then Nicholas sang a song he had just learned:</p>
    <pre class="testable">At nighttime in the moon&amp;rsquo;s fair glow How sweet, as fancies wander free, To feel that in this world there&amp;rsquo;s one Who still is thinking but of thee! That while her fingers touch the harp Wafting sweet music o&amp;rsquo;er the lea, It is for thee thus swells her heart, Sighing its message out to thee... A day or two, then bliss unspoilt, But oh! till then I cannot live!...</pre>
    <p>He had not finished the last verse before the young people began to get ready to dance in the large hall, and the sound of the feet and the coughing of the musicians were heard from the gallery.</p>
    <p>Pierre was sitting in the drawing room where Shinshín had engaged him, as a man recently returned from abroad, in a political conversation in which several others joined but which bored Pierre. When the music began Natásha came in and walking straight up to Pierre said, laughing and blushing:</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Mamma told me to ask you to join the dancers.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I am afraid of mixing the figures,&amp;rdquo; Pierre replied; &amp;ldquo;but if you will be my teacher...&amp;rdquo; And lowering his big arm he offered it to the slender little girl.</p>
    <p>While the couples were arranging themselves and the musicians tuning up, Pierre sat down with his little partner. Natásha was perfectly happy; she was dancing with a <i>grown-up</i> man, who had been <i>abroad</i>. She was sitting in a conspicuous place and talking to him like a grown-up lady. She had a fan in her hand that one of the ladies had given her to hold. Assuming quite the pose of a society woman (heaven knows when and where she had learned it) she talked with her partner, fanning herself and smiling over the fan.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Dear, dear! Just look at her!&amp;rdquo; exclaimed the countess as she crossed the ballroom, pointing to Natásha.</p>
    <p>Natásha blushed and laughed.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well, really, Mamma! Why should you? What is there to be surprised at?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>In the midst of the third <i>écossaise</i> there was a clatter of chairs being pushed back in the sitting room where the count and Márya Dmítrievna had been playing cards with the majority of the more distinguished and older visitors. They now, stretching themselves after sitting so long, and replacing their purses and pocketbooks, entered the ballroom. First came Márya Dmítrievna and the count, both with merry countenances. The count, with playful ceremony somewhat in ballet style, offered his bent arm to Márya Dmítrievna. He drew himself up, a smile of debonair gallantry lit up his face and as soon as the last figure of the <i>écossaise</i> was ended, he clapped his hands to the musicians and shouted up to their gallery, addressing the first violin:</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Semën! Do you know the <i>Daniel Cooper?</i>&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>This was the count&amp;rsquo;s favorite dance, which he had danced in his youth. (Strictly speaking, <i>Daniel Cooper</i> was one figure of the <i>anglaise</i>.)</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Look at Papa!&amp;rdquo; shouted Natásha to the whole company, and quite forgetting that she was dancing with a grown-up partner she bent her curly head to her knees and made the whole room ring with her laughter.</p>
    <p>And indeed everybody in the room looked with a smile of pleasure at the jovial old gentleman, who standing beside his tall and stout partner, Márya Dmítrievna, curved his arms, beat time, straightened his shoulders, turned out his toes, tapped gently with his foot, and, by a smile that broadened his round face more and more, prepared the onlookers for what was to follow. As soon as the provocatively gay strains of <i>Daniel Cooper</i> (somewhat resembling those of a merry peasant dance) began to sound, all the doorways of the ballroom were suddenly filled by the domestic serfs&amp;mdash;the men on one side and the women on the other&amp;mdash;who with beaming faces had come to see their master making merry.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Just look at the master! A regular eagle he is!&amp;rdquo; loudly remarked the nurse, as she stood in one of the doorways.</p>
    <p>The count danced well and knew it. But his partner could not and did not want to dance well. Her enormous figure stood erect, her powerful arms hanging down (she had handed her reticule to the countess), and only her stern but handsome face really joined in the dance. What was expressed by the whole of the count&amp;rsquo;s plump figure, in Márya Dmítrievna found expression only in her more and more beaming face and quivering nose. But if the count, getting more and more into the swing of it, charmed the spectators by the unexpectedness of his adroit maneuvers and the agility with which he capered about on his light feet, Márya Dmítrievna produced no less impression by slight exertions&amp;mdash;the least effort to move her shoulders or bend her arms when turning, or stamp her foot&amp;mdash;which everyone appreciated in view of her size and habitual severity. The dance grew livelier and livelier. The other couples could not attract a moment&amp;rsquo;s attention to their own evolutions and did not even try to do so. All were watching the count and Márya Dmítrievna. Natásha kept pulling everyone by sleeve or dress, urging them to &amp;ldquo;look at Papa!&amp;rdquo; though as it was they never took their eyes off the couple. In the intervals of the dance the count, breathing deeply, waved and shouted to the musicians to play faster. Faster, faster, and faster; lightly, more lightly, and yet more lightly whirled the count, flying round Márya Dmítrievna, now on his toes, now on his heels; until, turning his partner round to her seat, he executed the final <i>pas</i>, raising his soft foot backwards, bowing his perspiring head, smiling and making a wide sweep with his arm, amid a thunder of applause and laughter led by Natásha. Both partners stood still, breathing heavily and wiping their faces with their cambric handkerchiefs.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s how we used to dance in our time, <i>ma chère</i>,&amp;rdquo; said the count.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;That <i>was</i> a <i>Daniel Cooper!</i>&amp;rdquo; exclaimed Márya Dmítrievna, tucking up her sleeves and puffing heavily.</p>
    <h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
    <p>While in the Rostóvs&amp;rsquo; ballroom the sixth <i>anglaise</i> was being danced, to a tune in which the weary musicians blundered, and while tired footmen and cooks were getting the supper, Count Bezúkhov had a sixth stroke. The doctors pronounced recovery impossible. After a mute confession, communion was administered to the dying man, preparations made for the sacrament of unction, and in his house there was the bustle and thrill of suspense usual at such moments. Outside the house, beyond the gates, a group of undertakers, who hid whenever a carriage drove up, waited in expectation of an important order for an expensive funeral. The Military Governor of Moscow, who had been assiduous in sending aides-de-camp to inquire after the count&amp;rsquo;s health, came himself that evening to bid a last farewell to the celebrated grandee of Catherine&amp;rsquo;s court, Count Bezúkhov.</p>
    <p>The magnificent reception room was crowded. Everyone stood up respectfully when the Military Governor, having stayed about half an hour alone with the dying man, passed out, slightly acknowledging their bows and trying to escape as quickly as possible from the glances fixed on him by the doctors, clergy, and relatives of the family. Prince Vasíli, who had grown thinner and paler during the last few days, escorted him to the door, repeating something to him several times in low tones.</p>
    <p>When the Military Governor had gone, Prince Vasíli sat down all alone on a chair in the ballroom, crossing one leg high over the other, leaning his elbow on his knee and covering his face with his hand. After sitting so for a while he rose, and, looking about him with frightened eyes, went with unusually hurried steps down the long corridor leading to the back of the house, to the room of the eldest princess.</p>
    <p>Those who were in the dimly lit reception room spoke in nervous whispers, and, whenever anyone went into or came from the dying man&amp;rsquo;s room, grew silent and gazed with eyes full of curiosity or expectancy at his door, which creaked slightly when opened.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;The limits of human life ... are fixed and may not be o&amp;rsquo;erpassed,&amp;rdquo; said an old priest to a lady who had taken a seat beside him and was listening naïvely to his words.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I wonder, is it not too late to administer unction?&amp;rdquo; asked the lady, adding the priest&amp;rsquo;s clerical title, as if she had no opinion of her own on the subject.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Ah, madam, it is a great sacrament,&amp;rdquo; replied the priest, passing his hand over the thin grizzled strands of hair combed back across his bald head.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Who was that? The Military Governor himself?&amp;rdquo; was being asked at the other side of the room. &amp;ldquo;How young-looking he is!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Yes, and he is over sixty. I hear the count no longer recognizes anyone. They wished to administer the sacrament of unction.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I knew someone who received that sacrament seven times.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The second princess had just come from the sickroom with her eyes red from weeping and sat down beside Dr. Lorrain, who was sitting in a graceful pose under a portrait of Catherine, leaning his elbow on a table.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Beautiful,&amp;rdquo; said the doctor in answer to a remark about the weather. &amp;ldquo;The weather is beautiful, Princess; and besides, in Moscow one feels as if one were in the country.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Yes, indeed,&amp;rdquo; replied the princess with a sigh. &amp;ldquo;So he may have something to drink?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Lorrain considered.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Has he taken his medicine?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Yes.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The doctor glanced at his watch.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Take a glass of boiled water and put a pinch of cream of tartar,&amp;rdquo; and he indicated with his delicate fingers what he meant by a pinch.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Dere has neffer been a gase,&amp;rdquo; a German doctor was saying to an aide-de-camp, &amp;ldquo;dat one liffs after de sird stroke.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;And what a well-preserved man he was!&amp;rdquo; remarked the aide-de-camp. &amp;ldquo;And who will inherit his wealth?&amp;rdquo; he added in a whisper.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;It von&amp;rsquo;t go begging,&amp;rdquo; replied the German with a smile.</p>
    <p>Everyone again looked toward the door, which creaked as the second princess went in with the drink she had prepared according to Lorrain&amp;rsquo;s instructions. The German doctor went up to Lorrain.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Do you think he can last till morning?&amp;rdquo; asked the German, addressing Lorrain in French which he pronounced badly.</p>
    <p>Lorrain, pursing up his lips, waved a severely negative finger before his nose.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Tonight, not later,&amp;rdquo; said he in a low voice, and he moved away with a decorous smile of self-satisfaction at being able clearly to understand and state the patient&amp;rsquo;s condition.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile Prince Vasíli had opened the door into the princess&amp;rsquo; room.</p>
    <p>In this room it was almost dark; only two tiny lamps were burning before the icons and there was a pleasant scent of flowers and burnt pastilles. The room was crowded with small pieces of furniture, whatnots, cupboards, and little tables. The quilt of a high, white feather bed was just visible behind a screen. A small dog began to bark.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Ah, is it you, cousin?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>She rose and smoothed her hair, which was as usual so extremely smooth that it seemed to be made of one piece with her head and covered with varnish.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Has anything happened?&amp;rdquo; she asked. &amp;ldquo;I am so terrified.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;No, there is no change. I only came to have a talk about business, Catiche,&amp;rdquo; * muttered the prince, seating himself wearily on the chair she had just vacated. &amp;ldquo;You have made the place warm, I must say,&amp;rdquo; he remarked. &amp;ldquo;Well, sit down: let&amp;rsquo;s have a talk.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <pre class="testable">*Catherine.</pre>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I thought perhaps something had happened,&amp;rdquo; she said with her unchanging stonily severe expression; and, sitting down opposite the prince, she prepared to listen.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I wished to get a nap, <i>mon cousin</i>, but I can&amp;rsquo;t.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well, my dear?&amp;rdquo; said Prince Vasíli, taking her hand and bending it downwards as was his habit.</p>
    <p>It was plain that this &amp;ldquo;well?&amp;rdquo; referred to much that they both understood without naming.</p>
    <p>The princess, who had a straight, rigid body, abnormally long for her legs, looked directly at Prince Vasíli with no sign of emotion in her prominent gray eyes. Then she shook her head and glanced up at the icons with a sigh. This might have been taken as an expression of sorrow and devotion, or of weariness and hope of resting before long. Prince Vasíli understood it as an expression of weariness.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;And I?&amp;rdquo; he said; &amp;ldquo;do you think it is easier for me? I am as worn out as a post horse, but still I must have a talk with you, Catiche, a very serious talk.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Prince Vasíli said no more and his cheeks began to twitch nervously, now on one side, now on the other, giving his face an unpleasant expression which was never to be seen on it in a drawing room. His eyes too seemed strange; at one moment they looked impudently sly and at the next glanced round in alarm.</p>
    <p>The princess, holding her little dog on her lap with her thin bony hands, looked attentively into Prince Vasíli&amp;rsquo;s eyes evidently resolved not to be the first to break silence, if she had to wait till morning.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well, you see, my dear princess and cousin, Catherine Semënovna,&amp;rdquo; continued Prince Vasíli, returning to his theme, apparently not without an inner struggle; &amp;ldquo;at such a moment as this one must think of everything. One must think of the future, of all of you... I love you all, like children of my own, as you know.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The princess continued to look at him without moving, and with the same dull expression.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;And then of course my family has also to be considered,&amp;rdquo; Prince Vasíli went on, testily pushing away a little table without looking at her. &amp;ldquo;You know, Catiche, that we&amp;mdash;you three sisters, Mámontov, and my wife&amp;mdash;are the count&amp;rsquo;s only direct heirs. I know, I know how hard it is for you to talk or think of such matters. It is no easier for me; but, my dear, I am getting on for sixty and must be prepared for anything. Do you know I have sent for Pierre? The count,&amp;rdquo; pointing to his portrait, &amp;ldquo;definitely demanded that he should be called.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Prince Vasíli looked questioningly at the princess, but could not make out whether she was considering what he had just said or whether she was simply looking at him.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;There is one thing I constantly pray God to grant, <i>mon cousin</i>,&amp;rdquo; she replied, &amp;ldquo;and it is that He would be merciful to him and would allow his noble soul peacefully to leave this...&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Yes, yes, of course,&amp;rdquo; interrupted Prince Vasíli impatiently, rubbing his bald head and angrily pulling back toward him the little table that he had pushed away. &amp;ldquo;But... in short, the fact is... you know yourself that last winter the count made a will by which he left all his property, not to us his direct heirs, but to Pierre.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;He has made wills enough!&amp;rdquo; quietly remarked the princess. &amp;ldquo;But he cannot leave the estate to Pierre. Pierre is illegitimate.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;But, my dear,&amp;rdquo; said Prince Vasíli suddenly, clutching the little table and becoming more animated and talking more rapidly: &amp;ldquo;what if a letter has been written to the Emperor in which the count asks for Pierre&amp;rsquo;s legitimation? Do you understand that in consideration of the count&amp;rsquo;s services, his request would be granted?...&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The princess smiled as people do who think they know more about the subject under discussion than those they are talking with.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I can tell you more,&amp;rdquo; continued Prince Vasíli, seizing her hand, &amp;ldquo;that letter was written, though it was not sent, and the Emperor knew of it. The only question is, has it been destroyed or not? If not, then as soon as <i>all is over</i>,&amp;rdquo; and Prince Vasíli sighed to intimate what he meant by the words <i>all is over</i>, &amp;ldquo;and the count&amp;rsquo;s papers are opened, the will and letter will be delivered to the Emperor, and the petition will certainly be granted. Pierre will get everything as the legitimate son.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;And our share?&amp;rdquo; asked the princess smiling ironically, as if anything might happen, only not that.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;But, my poor Catiche, it is as clear as daylight! He will then be the legal heir to everything and you won&amp;rsquo;t get anything. You must know, my dear, whether the will and letter were written, and whether they have been destroyed or not. And if they have somehow been overlooked, you ought to know where they are, and must find them, because...&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;What next?&amp;rdquo; the princess interrupted, smiling sardonically and not changing the expression of her eyes. &amp;ldquo;I am a woman, and you think we are all stupid; but I know this: an illegitimate son cannot inherit... <i>un bâtard!</i>&amp;rdquo;* she added, as if supposing that this translation of the word would effectively prove to Prince Vasíli the invalidity of his contention.</p>
    <pre class="testable">* A bastard.</pre>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well, really, Catiche! Can&amp;rsquo;t you understand! You are so intelligent, how is it you don&amp;rsquo;t see that if the count has written a letter to the Emperor begging him to recognize Pierre as legitimate, it follows that Pierre will not be Pierre but will become Count Bezúkhov, and will then inherit everything under the will? And if the will and letter are not destroyed, then you will have nothing but the consolation of having been dutiful <i>et tout ce qui s&amp;rsquo;ensuit!</i>* That&amp;rsquo;s certain.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <pre class="testable">* And all that follows therefrom.</pre>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I know the will was made, but I also know that it is invalid; and you, <i>mon cousin</i>, seem to consider me a perfect fool,&amp;rdquo; said the princess with the expression women assume when they suppose they are saying something witty and stinging.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;My dear Princess Catherine Semënovna,&amp;rdquo; began Prince Vasíli impatiently, &amp;ldquo;I came here not to wrangle with you, but to talk about your interests as with a kinswoman, a good, kind, true relation. And I tell you for the tenth time that if the letter to the Emperor and the will in Pierre&amp;rsquo;s favor are among the count&amp;rsquo;s papers, then, my dear girl, you and your sisters are not heiresses! If you don&amp;rsquo;t believe me, then believe an expert. I have just been talking to Dmítri Onúfrich&amp;rdquo; (the family solicitor) &amp;ldquo;and he says the same.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>At this a sudden change evidently took place in the princess&amp;rsquo; ideas; her thin lips grew white, though her eyes did not change, and her voice when she began to speak passed through such transitions as she herself evidently did not expect.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;That would be a fine thing!&amp;rdquo; said she. &amp;ldquo;I never wanted anything and I don&amp;rsquo;t now.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>She pushed the little dog off her lap and smoothed her dress.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;And this is gratitude&amp;mdash;this is recognition for those who have sacrificed everything for his sake!&amp;rdquo; she cried. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s splendid! Fine! I don&amp;rsquo;t want anything, Prince.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Yes, but you are not the only one. There are your sisters...&amp;rdquo; replied Prince Vasíli.</p>
    <p>But the princess did not listen to him.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Yes, I knew it long ago but had forgotten. I knew that I could expect nothing but meanness, deceit, envy, intrigue, and ingratitude&amp;mdash;the blackest ingratitude&amp;mdash;in this house...&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Do you or do you not know where that will is?&amp;rdquo; insisted Prince Vasíli, his cheeks twitching more than ever.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Yes, I was a fool! I still believed in people, loved them, and sacrificed myself. But only the base, the vile succeed! I know who has been intriguing!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The princess wished to rise, but the prince held her by the hand. She had the air of one who has suddenly lost faith in the whole human race. She gave her companion an angry glance.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;There is still time, my dear. You must remember, Catiche, that it was all done casually in a moment of anger, of illness, and was afterwards forgotten. Our duty, my dear, is to rectify his mistake, to ease his last moments by not letting him commit this injustice, and not to let him die feeling that he is rendering unhappy those who...&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Who sacrificed everything for him,&amp;rdquo; chimed in the princess, who would again have risen had not the prince still held her fast, &amp;ldquo;though he never could appreciate it. No, <i>mon cousin</i>,&amp;rdquo; she added with a sigh, &amp;ldquo;I shall always remember that in this world one must expect no reward, that in this world there is neither honor nor justice. In this world one has to be cunning and cruel.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Now come, come! Be reasonable. I know your excellent heart.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;No, I have a wicked heart.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I know your heart,&amp;rdquo; repeated the prince. &amp;ldquo;I value your friendship and wish you to have as good an opinion of me. Don&amp;rsquo;t upset yourself, and let us talk sensibly while there is still time, be it a day or be it but an hour.... Tell me all you know about the will, and above all where it is. You must know. We will take it at once and show it to the count. He has, no doubt, forgotten it and will wish to destroy it. You understand that my sole desire is conscientiously to carry out his wishes; that is my only reason for being here. I came simply to help him and you.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Now I see it all! I know who has been intriguing&amp;mdash;I know!&amp;rdquo; cried the princess.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s not the point, my dear.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s that protégé of yours, that sweet Princess Drubetskáya, that Anna Mikháylovna whom I would not take for a housemaid... the infamous, vile woman!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Do not let us lose any time...&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Ah, don&amp;rsquo;t talk to me! Last winter she wheedled herself in here and told the count such vile, disgraceful things about us, especially about Sophie&amp;mdash;I can&amp;rsquo;t repeat them&amp;mdash;that it made the count quite ill and he would not see us for a whole fortnight. I know it was then he wrote this vile, infamous paper, but I thought the thing was invalid.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ve got to it at last&amp;mdash;why did you not tell me about it sooner?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s in the inlaid portfolio that he keeps under his pillow,&amp;rdquo; said the princess, ignoring his question. &amp;ldquo;Now I know! Yes; if I have a sin, a great sin, it is hatred of that vile woman!&amp;rdquo; almost shrieked the princess, now quite changed. &amp;ldquo;And what does she come worming herself in here for? But I will give her a piece of my mind. The time will come!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
    <p>While these conversations were going on in the reception room and the princess&amp;rsquo; room, a carriage containing Pierre (who had been sent for) and Anna Mikháylovna (who found it necessary to accompany him) was driving into the court of Count Bezúkhov&amp;rsquo;s house. As the wheels rolled softly over the straw beneath the windows, Anna Mikháylovna, having turned with words of comfort to her companion, realized that he was asleep in his corner and woke him up. Rousing himself, Pierre followed Anna Mikháylovna out of the carriage, and only then began to think of the interview with his dying father which awaited him. He noticed that they had not come to the front entrance but to the back door. While he was getting down from the carriage steps two men, who looked like tradespeople, ran hurriedly from the entrance and hid in the shadow of the wall. Pausing for a moment, Pierre noticed several other men of the same kind hiding in the shadow of the house on both sides. But neither Anna Mikháylovna nor the footman nor the coachman, who could not help seeing these people, took any notice of them. &amp;ldquo;It seems to be all right,&amp;rdquo; Pierre concluded, and followed Anna Mikháylovna. She hurriedly ascended the narrow dimly lit stone staircase, calling to Pierre, who was lagging behind, to follow. Though he did not see why it was necessary for him to go to the count at all, still less why he had to go by the back stairs, yet judging by Anna Mikháylovna&amp;rsquo;s air of assurance and haste, Pierre concluded that it was all absolutely necessary. Halfway up the stairs they were almost knocked over by some men who, carrying pails, came running downstairs, their boots clattering. These men pressed close to the wall to let Pierre and Anna Mikháylovna pass and did not evince the least surprise at seeing them there.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Is this the way to the princesses&amp;rsquo; apartments?&amp;rdquo; asked Anna Mikháylovna of one of them.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Yes,&amp;rdquo; replied a footman in a bold loud voice, as if anything were now permissible; &amp;ldquo;the door to the left, ma&amp;rsquo;am.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Perhaps the count did not ask for me,&amp;rdquo; said Pierre when he reached the landing. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;d better go to my own room.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Anna Mikháylovna paused and waited for him to come up.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Ah, my friend!&amp;rdquo; she said, touching his arm as she had done her son&amp;rsquo;s when speaking to him that afternoon, &amp;ldquo;believe me I suffer no less than you do, but be a man!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;But really, hadn&amp;rsquo;t I better go away?&amp;rdquo; he asked, looking kindly at her over his spectacles.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Ah, my dear friend! Forget the wrongs that may have been done you. Think that he is your father ... perhaps in the agony of death.&amp;rdquo; She sighed. &amp;ldquo;I have loved you like a son from the first. Trust yourself to me, Pierre. I shall not forget your interests.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Pierre did not understand a word, but the conviction that all this had to be grew stronger, and he meekly followed Anna Mikháylovna who was already opening a door.</p>
    <p>This door led into a back anteroom. An old man, a servant of the princesses, sat in a corner knitting a stocking. Pierre had never been in this part of the house and did not even know of the existence of these rooms. Anna Mikháylovna, addressing a maid who was hurrying past with a decanter on a tray as &amp;ldquo;my dear&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;my sweet,&amp;rdquo; asked about the princess&amp;rsquo; health and then led Pierre along a stone passage. The first door on the left led into the princesses&amp;rsquo; apartments. The maid with the decanter in her haste had not closed the door (everything in the house was done in haste at that time), and Pierre and Anna Mikháylovna in passing instinctively glanced into the room, where Prince Vasíli and the eldest princess were sitting close together talking. Seeing them pass, Prince Vasíli drew back with obvious impatience, while the princess jumped up and with a gesture of desperation slammed the door with all her might.</p>
    <p>This action was so unlike her usual composure and the fear depicted on Prince Vasíli&amp;rsquo;s face so out of keeping with his dignity that Pierre stopped and glanced inquiringly over his spectacles at his guide. Anna Mikháylovna evinced no surprise, she only smiled faintly and sighed, as if to say that this was no more than she had expected.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Be a man, my friend. I will look after your interests,&amp;rdquo; said she in reply to his look, and went still faster along the passage.</p>
    <p>Pierre could not make out what it was all about, and still less what &amp;ldquo;watching over his interests&amp;rdquo; meant, but he decided that all these things had to be. From the passage they went into a large, dimly lit room adjoining the count&amp;rsquo;s reception room. It was one of those sumptuous but cold apartments known to Pierre only from the front approach, but even in this room there now stood an empty bath, and water had been spilled on the carpet. They were met by a deacon with a censer and by a servant who passed out on tiptoe without heeding them. They went into the reception room familiar to Pierre, with two Italian windows opening into the conservatory, with its large bust and full length portrait of Catherine the Great. The same people were still sitting here in almost the same positions as before, whispering to one another. All became silent and turned to look at the pale tear-worn Anna Mikháylovna as she entered, and at the big stout figure of Pierre who, hanging his head, meekly followed her.</p>
    <p>Anna Mikháylovna&amp;rsquo;s face expressed a consciousness that the decisive moment had arrived. With the air of a practical Petersburg lady she now, keeping Pierre close beside her, entered the room even more boldly than that afternoon. She felt that as she brought with her the person the dying man wished to see, her own admission was assured. Casting a rapid glance at all those in the room and noticing the count&amp;rsquo;s confessor there, she glided up to him with a sort of amble, not exactly bowing yet seeming to grow suddenly smaller, and respectfully received the blessing first of one and then of another priest.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;God be thanked that you are in time,&amp;rdquo; said she to one of the priests; &amp;ldquo;all we relatives have been in such anxiety. This young man is the count&amp;rsquo;s son,&amp;rdquo; she added more softly. &amp;ldquo;What a terrible moment!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Having said this she went up to the doctor.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Dear doctor,&amp;rdquo; said she, &amp;ldquo;this young man is the count&amp;rsquo;s son. Is there any hope?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The doctor cast a rapid glance upwards and silently shrugged his shoulders. Anna Mikháylovna with just the same movement raised her shoulders and eyes, almost closing the latter, sighed, and moved away from the doctor to Pierre. To him, in a particularly respectful and tenderly sad voice, she said:</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Trust in His mercy!&amp;rdquo; and pointing out a small sofa for him to sit and wait for her, she went silently toward the door that everyone was watching and it creaked very slightly as she disappeared behind it.</p>
    <p>Pierre, having made up his mind to obey his monitress implicitly, moved toward the sofa she had indicated. As soon as Anna Mikháylovna had disappeared he noticed that the eyes of all in the room turned to him with something more than curiosity and sympathy. He noticed that they whispered to one another, casting significant looks at him with a kind of awe and even servility. A deference such as he had never before received was shown him. A strange lady, the one who had been talking to the priests, rose and offered him her seat; an aide-de-camp picked up and returned a glove Pierre had dropped; the doctors became respectfully silent as he passed by, and moved to make way for him. At first Pierre wished to take another seat so as not to trouble the lady, and also to pick up the glove himself and to pass round the doctors who were not even in his way; but all at once he felt that this would not do, and that tonight he was a person obliged to perform some sort of awful rite which everyone expected of him, and that he was therefore bound to accept their services. He took the glove in silence from the aide-de-camp, and sat down in the lady&amp;rsquo;s chair, placing his huge hands symmetrically on his knees in the naïve attitude of an Egyptian statue, and decided in his own mind that all was as it should be, and that in order not to lose his head and do foolish things he must not act on his own ideas tonight, but must yield himself up entirely to the will of those who were guiding him.</p>
    <p>Not two minutes had passed before Prince Vasíli with head erect majestically entered the room. He was wearing his long coat with three stars on his breast. He seemed to have grown thinner since the morning; his eyes seemed larger than usual when he glanced round and noticed Pierre. He went up to him, took his hand (a thing he never used to do), and drew it downwards as if wishing to ascertain whether it was firmly fixed on.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Courage, courage, my friend! He has asked to see you. That is well!&amp;rdquo; and he turned to go.</p>
    <p>But Pierre thought it necessary to ask: &amp;ldquo;How is...&amp;rdquo; and hesitated, not knowing whether it would be proper to call the dying man &amp;ldquo;the count,&amp;rdquo; yet ashamed to call him &amp;ldquo;father.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;He had another stroke about half an hour ago. Courage, my friend...&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Pierre&amp;rsquo;s mind was in such a confused state that the word &amp;ldquo;stroke&amp;rdquo; suggested to him a blow from something. He looked at Prince Vasíli in perplexity, and only later grasped that a stroke was an attack of illness. Prince Vasíli said something to Lorrain in passing and went through the door on tiptoe. He could not walk well on tiptoe and his whole body jerked at each step. The eldest princess followed him, and the priests and deacons and some servants also went in at the door. Through that door was heard a noise of things being moved about, and at last Anna Mikháylovna, still with the same expression, pale but resolute in the discharge of duty, ran out and touching Pierre lightly on the arm said:</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;The divine mercy is inexhaustible! Unction is about to be administered. Come.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Pierre went in at the door, stepping on the soft carpet, and noticed that the strange lady, the aide-de-camp, and some of the servants, all followed him in, as if there were now no further need for permission to enter that room.</p>
    <h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
    <p>Pierre well knew this large room divided by columns and an arch, its walls hung round with Persian carpets. The part of the room behind the columns, with a high silk-curtained mahogany bedstead on one side and on the other an immense case containing icons, was brightly illuminated with red light like a Russian church during evening service. Under the gleaming icons stood a long invalid chair, and in that chair on snowy-white smooth pillows, evidently freshly changed, Pierre saw&amp;mdash;covered to the waist by a bright green quilt&amp;mdash;the familiar, majestic figure of his father, Count Bezúkhov, with that gray mane of hair above his broad forehead which reminded one of a lion, and the deep characteristically noble wrinkles of his handsome, ruddy face. He lay just under the icons; his large thick hands outside the quilt. Into the right hand, which was lying palm downwards, a wax taper had been thrust between forefinger and thumb, and an old servant, bending over from behind the chair, held it in position. By the chair stood the priests, their long hair falling over their magnificent glittering vestments, with lighted tapers in their hands, slowly and solemnly conducting the service. A little behind them stood the two younger princesses holding handkerchiefs to their eyes, and just in front of them their eldest sister, Catiche, with a vicious and determined look steadily fixed on the icons, as though declaring to all that she could not answer for herself should she glance round. Anna Mikháylovna, with a meek, sorrowful, and all-forgiving expression on her face, stood by the door near the strange lady. Prince Vasíli in front of the door, near the invalid chair, a wax taper in his left hand, was leaning his left arm on the carved back of a velvet chair he had turned round for the purpose, and was crossing himself with his right hand, turning his eyes upward each time he touched his forehead. His face wore a calm look of piety and resignation to the will of God. &amp;ldquo;If you do not understand these sentiments,&amp;rdquo; he seemed to be saying, &amp;ldquo;so much the worse for you!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Behind him stood the aide-de-camp, the doctors, and the menservants; the men and women had separated as in church. All were silently crossing themselves, and the reading of the church service, the subdued chanting of deep bass voices, and in the intervals sighs and the shuffling of feet were the only sounds that could be heard. Anna Mikháylovna, with an air of importance that showed that she felt she quite knew what she was about, went across the room to where Pierre was standing and gave him a taper. He lit it and, distracted by observing those around him, began crossing himself with the hand that held the taper.</p>
    <p>Sophie, the rosy, laughter-loving, youngest princess with the mole, watched him. She smiled, hid her face in her handkerchief, and remained with it hidden for awhile; then looking up and seeing Pierre she again began to laugh. She evidently felt unable to look at him without laughing, but could not resist looking at him: so to be out of temptation she slipped quietly behind one of the columns. In the midst of the service the voices of the priests suddenly ceased, they whispered to one another, and the old servant who was holding the count&amp;rsquo;s hand got up and said something to the ladies. Anna Mikháylovna stepped forward and, stooping over the dying man, beckoned to Lorrain from behind her back. The French doctor held no taper; he was leaning against one of the columns in a respectful attitude implying that he, a foreigner, in spite of all differences of faith, understood the full importance of the rite now being performed and even approved of it. He now approached the sick man with the noiseless step of one in full vigor of life, with his delicate white fingers raised from the green quilt the hand that was free, and turning sideways felt the pulse and reflected a moment. The sick man was given something to drink, there was a stir around him, then the people resumed their places and the service continued. During this interval Pierre noticed that Prince Vasíli left the chair on which he had been leaning, and&amp;mdash;with an air which intimated that he knew what he was about and if others did not understand him it was so much the worse for them&amp;mdash;did not go up to the dying man, but passed by him, joined the eldest princess, and moved with her to the side of the room where stood the high bedstead with its silken hangings. On leaving the bed both Prince Vasíli and the princess passed out by a back door, but returned to their places one after the other before the service was concluded. Pierre paid no more attention to this occurrence than to the rest of what went on, having made up his mind once for all that what he saw happening around him that evening was in some way essential.</p>
    <p>The chanting of the service ceased, and the voice of the priest was heard respectfully congratulating the dying man on having received the sacrament. The dying man lay as lifeless and immovable as before. Around him everyone began to stir: steps were audible and whispers, among which Anna Mikháylovna&amp;rsquo;s was the most distinct.</p>
    <p>Pierre heard her say:</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Certainly he must be moved onto the bed; here it will be impossible...&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The sick man was so surrounded by doctors, princesses, and servants that Pierre could no longer see the reddish-yellow face with its gray mane&amp;mdash;which, though he saw other faces as well, he had not lost sight of for a single moment during the whole service. He judged by the cautious movements of those who crowded round the invalid chair that they had lifted the dying man and were moving him.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Catch hold of my arm or you&amp;rsquo;ll drop him!&amp;rdquo; he heard one of the servants say in a frightened whisper. &amp;ldquo;Catch hold from underneath. Here!&amp;rdquo; exclaimed different voices; and the heavy breathing of the bearers and the shuffling of their feet grew more hurried, as if the weight they were carrying were too much for them.</p>
    <p>As the bearers, among whom was Anna Mikháylovna, passed the young man he caught a momentary glimpse between their heads and backs of the dying man&amp;rsquo;s high, stout, uncovered chest and powerful shoulders, raised by those who were holding him under the armpits, and of his gray, curly, leonine head. This head, with its remarkably broad brow and cheekbones, its handsome, sensual mouth, and its cold, majestic expression, was not disfigured by the approach of death. It was the same as Pierre remembered it three months before, when the count had sent him to Petersburg. But now this head was swaying helplessly with the uneven movements of the bearers, and the cold listless gaze fixed itself upon nothing.</p>
    <p>After a few minutes&amp;rsquo; bustle beside the high bedstead, those who had carried the sick man dispersed. Anna Mikháylovna touched Pierre&amp;rsquo;s hand and said, &amp;ldquo;Come.&amp;rdquo; Pierre went with her to the bed on which the sick man had been laid in a stately pose in keeping with the ceremony just completed. He lay with his head propped high on the pillows. His hands were symmetrically placed on the green silk quilt, the palms downward. When Pierre came up the count was gazing straight at him, but with a look the significance of which could not be understood by mortal man. Either this look meant nothing but that as long as one has eyes they must look somewhere, or it meant too much. Pierre hesitated, not knowing what to do, and glanced inquiringly at his guide. Anna Mikháylovna made a hurried sign with her eyes, glancing at the sick man&amp;rsquo;s hand and moving her lips as if to send it a kiss. Pierre, carefully stretching his neck so as not to touch the quilt, followed her suggestion and pressed his lips to the large boned, fleshy hand. Neither the hand nor a single muscle of the count&amp;rsquo;s face stirred. Once more Pierre looked questioningly at Anna Mikháylovna to see what he was to do next. Anna Mikháylovna with her eyes indicated a chair that stood beside the bed. Pierre obediently sat down, his eyes asking if he were doing right. Anna Mikháylovna nodded approvingly. Again Pierre fell into the naïvely symmetrical pose of an Egyptian statue, evidently distressed that his stout and clumsy body took up so much room and doing his utmost to look as small as possible. He looked at the count, who still gazed at the spot where Pierre&amp;rsquo;s face had been before he sat down. Anna Mikháylovna indicated by her attitude her consciousness of the pathetic importance of these last moments of meeting between the father and son. This lasted about two minutes, which to Pierre seemed an hour. Suddenly the broad muscles and lines of the count&amp;rsquo;s face began to twitch. The twitching increased, the handsome mouth was drawn to one side (only now did Pierre realize how near death his father was), and from that distorted mouth issued an indistinct, hoarse sound. Anna Mikháylovna looked attentively at the sick man&amp;rsquo;s eyes, trying to guess what he wanted; she pointed first to Pierre, then to some drink, then named Prince Vasíli in an inquiring whisper, then pointed to the quilt. The eyes and face of the sick man showed impatience. He made an effort to look at the servant who stood constantly at the head of the bed.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Wants to turn on the other side,&amp;rdquo; whispered the servant, and got up to turn the count&amp;rsquo;s heavy body toward the wall.</p>
    <p>Pierre rose to help him.</p>
    <p>While the count was being turned over, one of his arms fell back helplessly and he made a fruitless effort to pull it forward. Whether he noticed the look of terror with which Pierre regarded that lifeless arm, or whether some other thought flitted across his dying brain, at any rate he glanced at the refractory arm, at Pierre&amp;rsquo;s terror-stricken face, and again at the arm, and on his face a feeble, piteous smile appeared, quite out of keeping with his features, that seemed to deride his own helplessness. At sight of this smile Pierre felt an unexpected quivering in his breast and a tickling in his nose, and tears dimmed his eyes. The sick man was turned on to his side with his face to the wall. He sighed.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;He is dozing,&amp;rdquo; said Anna Mikháylovna, observing that one of the princesses was coming to take her turn at watching. &amp;ldquo;Let us go.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Pierre went out.</p>
    <h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
    <p>There was now no one in the reception room except Prince Vasíli and the eldest princess, who were sitting under the portrait of Catherine the Great and talking eagerly. As soon as they saw Pierre and his companion they became silent, and Pierre thought he saw the princess hide something as she whispered:</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I can&amp;rsquo;t bear the sight of that woman.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Catiche has had tea served in the small drawing room,&amp;rdquo; said Prince Vasíli to Anna Mikháylovna. &amp;ldquo;Go and take something, my poor Anna Mikháylovna, or you will not hold out.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>To Pierre he said nothing, merely giving his arm a sympathetic squeeze below the shoulder. Pierre went with Anna Mikháylovna into the small drawing room.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;There is nothing so refreshing after a sleepless night as a cup of this delicious Russian tea,&amp;rdquo; Lorrain was saying with an air of restrained animation as he stood sipping tea from a delicate Chinese handleless cup before a table on which tea and a cold supper were laid in the small circular room. Around the table all who were at Count Bezúkhov&amp;rsquo;s house that night had gathered to fortify themselves. Pierre well remembered this small circular drawing room with its mirrors and little tables. During balls given at the house Pierre, who did not know how to dance, had liked sitting in this room to watch the ladies who, as they passed through in their ball dresses with diamonds and pearls on their bare shoulders, looked at themselves in the brilliantly lighted mirrors which repeated their reflections several times. Now this same room was dimly lighted by two candles. On one small table tea things and supper dishes stood in disorder, and in the middle of the night a motley throng of people sat there, not merrymaking, but somberly whispering, and betraying by every word and movement that they none of them forgot what was happening and what was about to happen in the bedroom. Pierre did not eat anything though he would very much have liked to. He looked inquiringly at his monitress and saw that she was again going on tiptoe to the reception room where they had left Prince Vasíli and the eldest princess. Pierre concluded that this also was essential, and after a short interval followed her. Anna Mikháylovna was standing beside the princess, and they were both speaking in excited whispers.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Permit me, Princess, to know what is necessary and what is not necessary,&amp;rdquo; said the younger of the two speakers, evidently in the same state of excitement as when she had slammed the door of her room.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;But, my dear princess,&amp;rdquo; answered Anna Mikháylovna blandly but impressively, blocking the way to the bedroom and preventing the other from passing, &amp;ldquo;won&amp;rsquo;t this be too much for poor Uncle at a moment when he needs repose? Worldly conversation at a moment when his soul is already prepared...&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Prince Vasíli was seated in an easy chair in his familiar attitude, with one leg crossed high above the other. His cheeks, which were so flabby that they looked heavier below, were twitching violently; but he wore the air of a man little concerned in what the two ladies were saying.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Come, my dear Anna Mikháylovna, let Catiche do as she pleases. You know how fond the count is of her.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t even know what is in this paper,&amp;rdquo; said the younger of the two ladies, addressing Prince Vasíli and pointing to an inlaid portfolio she held in her hand. &amp;ldquo;All I know is that his real will is in his writing table, and this is a paper he has forgotten....&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>She tried to pass Anna Mikháylovna, but the latter sprang so as to bar her path.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I know, my dear, kind princess,&amp;rdquo; said Anna Mikháylovna, seizing the portfolio so firmly that it was plain she would not let go easily. &amp;ldquo;Dear princess, I beg and implore you, have some pity on him! <i>Je vous en conjure</i>...&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The princess did not reply. Their efforts in the struggle for the portfolio were the only sounds audible, but it was evident that if the princess did speak, her words would not be flattering to Anna Mikháylovna. Though the latter held on tenaciously, her voice lost none of its honeyed firmness and softness.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Pierre, my dear, come here. I think he will not be out of place in a family consultation; is it not so, Prince?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Why don&amp;rsquo;t you speak, cousin?&amp;rdquo; suddenly shrieked the princess so loud that those in the drawing room heard her and were startled. &amp;ldquo;Why do you remain silent when heaven knows who permits herself to interfere, making a scene on the very threshold of a dying man&amp;rsquo;s room? Intriguer!&amp;rdquo; she hissed viciously, and tugged with all her might at the portfolio.</p>
    <p>But Anna Mikháylovna went forward a step or two to keep her hold on the portfolio, and changed her grip.</p>
    <p>Prince Vasíli rose. &amp;ldquo;Oh!&amp;rdquo; said he with reproach and surprise, &amp;ldquo;this is absurd! Come, let go I tell you.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The princess let go.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;And you too!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>But Anna Mikháylovna did not obey him.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Let go, I tell you! I will take the responsibility. I myself will go and ask him, I!... does that satisfy you?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;But, Prince,&amp;rdquo; said Anna Mikháylovna, &amp;ldquo;after such a solemn sacrament, allow him a moment&amp;rsquo;s peace! Here, Pierre, tell them your opinion,&amp;rdquo; said she, turning to the young man who, having come quite close, was gazing with astonishment at the angry face of the princess which had lost all dignity, and at the twitching cheeks of Prince Vasíli.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Remember that you will answer for the consequences,&amp;rdquo; said Prince Vasíli severely. &amp;ldquo;You don&amp;rsquo;t know what you are doing.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Vile woman!&amp;rdquo; shouted the princess, darting unexpectedly at Anna Mikháylovna and snatching the portfolio from her.</p>
    <p>Prince Vasíli bent his head and spread out his hands.</p>
    <p>At this moment that terrible door, which Pierre had watched so long and which had always opened so quietly, burst noisily open and banged against the wall, and the second of the three sisters rushed out wringing her hands.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;What are you doing!&amp;rdquo; she cried vehemently. &amp;ldquo;He is dying and you leave me alone with him!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Her sister dropped the portfolio. Anna Mikháylovna, stooping, quickly caught up the object of contention and ran into the bedroom. The eldest princess and Prince Vasíli, recovering themselves, followed her. A few minutes later the eldest sister came out with a pale hard face, again biting her underlip. At sight of Pierre her expression showed an irrepressible hatred.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Yes, now you may be glad!&amp;rdquo; said she; &amp;ldquo;this is what you have been waiting for.&amp;rdquo; And bursting into tears she hid her face in her handkerchief and rushed from the room.</p>
    <p>Prince Vasíli came next. He staggered to the sofa on which Pierre was sitting and dropped onto it, covering his face with his hand. Pierre noticed that he was pale and that his jaw quivered and shook as if in an ague.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Ah, my friend!&amp;rdquo; said he, taking Pierre by the elbow; and there was in his voice a sincerity and weakness Pierre had never observed in it before. &amp;ldquo;How often we sin, how much we deceive, and all for what? I am near sixty, dear friend... I too... All will end in death, all! Death is awful...&amp;rdquo; and he burst into tears.</p>
    <p>Anna Mikháylovna came out last. She approached Pierre with slow, quiet steps.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Pierre!&amp;rdquo; she said.</p>
    <p>Pierre gave her an inquiring look. She kissed the young man on his forehead, wetting him with her tears. Then after a pause she said:</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;He is no more....&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Pierre looked at her over his spectacles.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Come, I will go with you. Try to weep, nothing gives such relief as tears.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>She led him into the dark drawing room and Pierre was glad no one could see his face. Anna Mikháylovna left him, and when she returned he was fast asleep with his head on his arm.</p>
    <p>In the morning Anna Mikháylovna said to Pierre:</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Yes, my dear, this is a great loss for us all, not to speak of you. But God will support you: you are young, and are now, I hope, in command of an immense fortune. The will has not yet been opened. I know you well enough to be sure that this will not turn your head, but it imposes duties on you, and you must be a man.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Pierre was silent.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Perhaps later on I may tell you, my dear boy, that if I had not been there, God only knows what would have happened! You know, Uncle promised me only the day before yesterday not to forget Borís. But he had no time. I hope, my dear friend, you will carry out your father&amp;rsquo;s wish?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Pierre understood nothing of all this and coloring shyly looked in silence at Princess Anna Mikháylovna. After her talk with Pierre, Anna Mikháylovna returned to the Rostóvs&amp;rsquo; and went to bed. On waking in the morning she told the Rostóvs and all her acquaintances the details of Count Bezúkhov&amp;rsquo;s death. She said the count had died as she would herself wish to die, that his end was not only touching but edifying. As to the last meeting between father and son, it was so touching that she could not think of it without tears, and did not know which had behaved better during those awful moments&amp;mdash;the father who so remembered everything and everybody at last and had spoken such pathetic words to the son, or Pierre, whom it had been pitiful to see, so stricken was he with grief, though he tried hard to hide it in order not to sadden his dying father. &amp;ldquo;It is painful, but it does one good. It uplifts the soul to see such men as the old count and his worthy son,&amp;rdquo; said she. Of the behavior of the eldest princess and Prince Vasíli she spoke disapprovingly, but in whispers and as a great secret.</p>
    <h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
    <p>At Bald Hills, Prince Nicholas Andréevich Bolkónski&amp;rsquo;s estate, the arrival of young Prince Andrew and his wife was daily expected, but this expectation did not upset the regular routine of life in the old prince&amp;rsquo;s household. General in Chief Prince Nicholas Andréevich (nicknamed in society, &amp;ldquo;the King of Prussia&amp;rdquo;) ever since the Emperor Paul had exiled him to his country estate had lived there continuously with his daughter, Princess Mary, and her companion, Mademoiselle Bourienne. Though in the new reign he was free to return to the capitals, he still continued to live in the country, remarking that anyone who wanted to see him could come the hundred miles from Moscow to Bald Hills, while he himself needed no one and nothing. He used to say that there are only two sources of human vice&amp;mdash;idleness and superstition, and only two virtues&amp;mdash;activity and intelligence. He himself undertook his daughter&amp;rsquo;s education, and to develop these two cardinal virtues in her gave her lessons in algebra and geometry till she was twenty, and arranged her life so that her whole time was occupied. He was himself always occupied: writing his memoirs, solving problems in higher mathematics, turning snuffboxes on a lathe, working in the garden, or superintending the building that was always going on at his estate. As regularity is a prime condition facilitating activity, regularity in his household was carried to the highest point of exactitude. He always came to table under precisely the same conditions, and not only at the same hour but at the same minute. With those about him, from his daughter to his serfs, the prince was sharp and invariably exacting, so that without being a hardhearted man he inspired such fear and respect as few hardhearted men would have aroused. Although he was in retirement and had now no influence in political affairs, every high official appointed to the province in which the prince&amp;rsquo;s estate lay considered it his duty to visit him and waited in the lofty antechamber just as the architect, gardener, or Princess Mary did, till the prince appeared punctually to the appointed hour. Everyone sitting in this antechamber experienced the same feeling of respect and even fear when the enormously high study door opened and showed the figure of a rather small old man, with powdered wig, small withered hands, and bushy gray eyebrows which, when he frowned, sometimes hid the gleam of his shrewd, youthfully glittering eyes.</p>
    <p>On the morning of the day that the young couple were to arrive, Princess Mary entered the antechamber as usual at the time appointed for the morning greeting, crossing herself with trepidation and repeating a silent prayer. Every morning she came in like that, and every morning prayed that the daily interview might pass off well.</p>
    <p>An old powdered manservant who was sitting in the antechamber rose quietly and said in a whisper: &amp;ldquo;Please walk in.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Through the door came the regular hum of a lathe. The princess timidly opened the door which moved noiselessly and easily. She paused at the entrance. The prince was working at the lathe and after glancing round continued his work.</p>
    <p>The enormous study was full of things evidently in constant use. The large table covered with books and plans, the tall glass-fronted bookcases with keys in the locks, the high desk for writing while standing up, on which lay an open exercise book, and the lathe with tools laid ready to hand and shavings scattered around&amp;mdash;all indicated continuous, varied, and orderly activity. The motion of the small foot shod in a Tartar boot embroidered with silver, and the firm pressure of the lean sinewy hand, showed that the prince still possessed the tenacious endurance and vigor of hardy old age. After a few more turns of the lathe he removed his foot from the pedal, wiped his chisel, dropped it into a leather pouch attached to the lathe, and, approaching the table, summoned his daughter. He never gave his children a blessing, so he simply held out his bristly cheek (as yet unshaven) and, regarding her tenderly and attentively, said severely:</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Quite well? All right then, sit down.&amp;rdquo; He took the exercise book containing lessons in geometry written by himself and drew up a chair with his foot.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;For tomorrow!&amp;rdquo; said he, quickly finding the page and making a scratch from one paragraph to another with his hard nail.</p>
    <p>The princess bent over the exercise book on the table.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Wait a bit, here&amp;rsquo;s a letter for you,&amp;rdquo; said the old man suddenly, taking a letter addressed in a woman&amp;rsquo;s hand from a bag hanging above the table, onto which he threw it.</p>
    <p>At the sight of the letter red patches showed themselves on the princess&amp;rsquo; face. She took it quickly and bent her head over it.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;From Héloïse?&amp;rdquo; asked the prince with a cold smile that showed his still sound, yellowish teeth.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s from Julie,&amp;rdquo; replied the princess with a timid glance and a timid smile.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll let two more letters pass, but the third I&amp;rsquo;ll read,&amp;rdquo; said the prince sternly; &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m afraid you write much nonsense. I&amp;rsquo;ll read the third!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Read this if you like, Father,&amp;rdquo; said the princess, blushing still more and holding out the letter.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;The third, I said the third!&amp;rdquo; cried the prince abruptly, pushing the letter away, and leaning his elbows on the table he drew toward him the exercise book containing geometrical figures.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well, madam,&amp;rdquo; he began, stooping over the book close to his daughter and placing an arm on the back of the chair on which she sat, so that she felt herself surrounded on all sides by the acrid scent of old age and tobacco, which she had known so long. &amp;ldquo;Now, madam, these triangles are equal; please note that the angle <i>ABC</i>...&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The princess looked in a scared way at her father&amp;rsquo;s eyes glittering close to her; the red patches on her face came and went, and it was plain that she understood nothing and was so frightened that her fear would prevent her understanding any of her father&amp;rsquo;s further explanations, however clear they might be. Whether it was the teacher&amp;rsquo;s fault or the pupil&amp;rsquo;s, this same thing happened every day: the princess&amp;rsquo; eyes grew dim, she could not see and could not hear anything, but was only conscious of her stern father&amp;rsquo;s withered face close to her, of his breath and the smell of him, and could think only of how to get away quickly to her own room to make out the problem in peace. The old man was beside himself: moved the chair on which he was sitting noisily backward and forward, made efforts to control himself and not become vehement, but almost always did become vehement, scolded, and sometimes flung the exercise book away.</p>
    <p>The princess gave a wrong answer.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well now, isn&amp;rsquo;t she a fool!&amp;rdquo; shouted the prince, pushing the book aside and turning sharply away; but rising immediately, he paced up and down, lightly touched his daughter&amp;rsquo;s hair and sat down again.</p>
    <p>He drew up his chair, and continued to explain.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;This won&amp;rsquo;t do, Princess; it won&amp;rsquo;t do,&amp;rdquo; said he, when Princess Mary, having taken and closed the exercise book with the next day&amp;rsquo;s lesson, was about to leave: &amp;ldquo;Mathematics are most important, madam! I don&amp;rsquo;t want to have you like our silly ladies. Get used to it and you&amp;rsquo;ll like it,&amp;rdquo; and he patted her cheek. &amp;ldquo;It will drive all the nonsense out of your head.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>She turned to go, but he stopped her with a gesture and took an uncut book from the high desk.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Here is some sort of <i>Key to the Mysteries</i> that your Héloïse has sent you. Religious! I don&amp;rsquo;t interfere with anyone&amp;rsquo;s belief... I have looked at it. Take it. Well, now go. Go.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>He patted her on the shoulder and himself closed the door after her.</p>
    <p>Princess Mary went back to her room with the sad, scared expression that rarely left her and which made her plain, sickly face yet plainer. She sat down at her writing table, on which stood miniature portraits and which was littered with books and papers. The princess was as untidy as her father was tidy. She put down the geometry book and eagerly broke the seal of her letter. It was from her most intimate friend from childhood; that same Julie Karágina who had been at the Rostóvs&amp;rsquo; name-day party.</p>
    <p>Julie wrote in French:</p>
    <p>Dear and precious Friend, How terrible and frightful a thing is separation! Though I tell myself that half my life and half my happiness are wrapped up in you, and that in spite of the distance separating us our hearts are united by indissoluble bonds, my heart rebels against fate and in spite of the pleasures and distractions around me I cannot overcome a certain secret sorrow that has been in my heart ever since we parted. Why are we not together as we were last summer, in your big study, on the blue sofa, the confidential sofa? Why cannot I now, as three months ago, draw fresh moral strength from your look, so gentle, calm, and penetrating, a look I loved so well and seem to see before me as I write?</p>
    <p>Having read thus far, Princess Mary sighed and glanced into the mirror which stood on her right. It reflected a weak, ungraceful figure and thin face. Her eyes, always sad, now looked with particular hopelessness at her reflection in the glass. &amp;ldquo;She flatters me,&amp;rdquo; thought the princess, turning away and continuing to read. But Julie did not flatter her friend, the princess&amp;rsquo; eyes&amp;mdash;large, deep and luminous (it seemed as if at times there radiated from them shafts of warm light)&amp;mdash;were so beautiful that very often in spite of the plainness of her face they gave her an attraction more powerful than that of beauty. But the princess never saw the beautiful expression of her own eyes&amp;mdash;the look they had when she was not thinking of herself. As with everyone, her face assumed a forced unnatural expression as soon as she looked in a glass. She went on reading:</p>
    <p>All Moscow talks of nothing but war. One of my two brothers is already abroad, the other is with the Guards, who are starting on their march to the frontier. Our dear Emperor has left Petersburg and it is thought intends to expose his precious person to the chances of war. God grant that the Corsican monster who is destroying the peace of Europe may be overthrown by the angel whom it has pleased the Almighty, in His goodness, to give us as sovereign! To say nothing of my brothers, this war has deprived me of one of the associations nearest my heart. I mean young Nicholas Rostóv, who with his enthusiasm could not bear to remain inactive and has left the university to join the army. I will confess to you, dear Mary, that in spite of his extreme youth his departure for the army was a great grief to me. This young man, of whom I spoke to you last summer, is so noble-minded and full of that real youthfulness which one seldom finds nowadays among our old men of twenty and, particularly, he is so frank and has so much heart. He is so pure and poetic that my relations with him, transient as they were, have been one of the sweetest comforts to my poor heart, which has already suffered so much. Someday I will tell you about our parting and all that was said then. That is still too fresh. Ah, dear friend, you are happy not to know these poignant joys and sorrows. You are fortunate, for the latter are generally the stronger! I know very well that Count Nicholas is too young ever to be more to me than a friend, but this sweet friendship, this poetic and pure intimacy, were what my heart needed. But enough of this! The chief news, about which all Moscow gossips, is the death of old Count Bezúkhov, and his inheritance. Fancy! The three princesses have received very little, Prince Vasíli nothing, and it is Monsieur Pierre who has inherited all the property and has besides been recognized as legitimate; so that he is now Count Bezúkhov and possessor of the finest fortune in Russia. It is rumored that Prince Vasíli played a very despicable part in this affair and that he returned to Petersburg quite crestfallen.</p>
    <p>I confess I understand very little about all these matters of wills and inheritance; but I do know that since this young man, whom we all used to know as plain Monsieur Pierre, has become Count Bezúkhov and the owner of one of the largest fortunes in Russia, I am much amused to watch the change in the tone and manners of the mammas burdened by marriageable daughters, and of the young ladies themselves, toward him, though, between you and me, he always seemed to me a poor sort of fellow. As for the past two years people have amused themselves by finding husbands for me (most of whom I don&amp;rsquo;t even know), the matchmaking chronicles of Moscow now speak of me as the future Countess Bezúkhova. But you will understand that I have no desire for the post. <i>À propos</i> of marriages: do you know that a while ago that <i>universal auntie</i> Anna Mikháylovna told me, under the seal of strict secrecy, of a plan of marriage for you. It is neither more nor less than with Prince Vasíli&amp;rsquo;s son Anatole, whom they wish to reform by marrying him to someone rich and <i>distinguée</i>, and it is on you that his relations&amp;rsquo; choice has fallen. I don&amp;rsquo;t know what you will think of it, but I consider it my duty to let you know of it. He is said to be very handsome and a terrible scapegrace. That is all I have been able to find out about him.</p>
    <p>But enough of gossip. I am at the end of my second sheet of paper, and Mamma has sent for me to go and dine at the Apráksins&amp;rsquo;. Read the mystical book I am sending you; it has an enormous success here. Though there are things in it difficult for the feeble human mind to grasp, it is an admirable book which calms and elevates the soul. Adieu! Give my respects to monsieur your father and my compliments to Mademoiselle Bourienne. I embrace you as I love you.</p>
    <p>JULIE</p>
    <p>P.S. Let me have news of your brother and his charming little wife.</p>
    <p>The princess pondered awhile with a thoughtful smile and her luminous eyes lit up so that her face was entirely transformed. Then she suddenly rose and with her heavy tread went up to the table. She took a sheet of paper and her hand moved rapidly over it. This is the reply she wrote, also in French:</p>
    <p>Dear and precious Friend, Your letter of the 13th has given me great delight. So you still love me, my romantic Julie? Separation, of which you say so much that is bad, does not seem to have had its usual effect on you. You complain of our separation. What then should I say, if I <i>dared</i> complain, I who am deprived of all who are dear to me? Ah, if we had not religion to console us life would be very sad. Why do you suppose that I should look severely on your affection for that young man? On such matters I am only severe with myself. I understand such feelings in others, and if never having felt them I cannot approve of them, neither do I condemn them. Only it seems to me that Christian love, love of one&amp;rsquo;s neighbor, love of one&amp;rsquo;s enemy, is worthier, sweeter, and better than the feelings which the beautiful eyes of a young man can inspire in a romantic and loving young girl like yourself.</p>
    <p>The news of Count Bezúkhov&amp;rsquo;s death reached us before your letter and my father was much affected by it. He says the count was the last representative but one of the great century, and that it is his own turn now, but that he will do all he can to let his turn come as late as possible. God preserve us from that terrible misfortune!</p>
    <p>I cannot agree with you about Pierre, whom I knew as a child. He always seemed to me to have an excellent heart, and that is the quality I value most in people. As to his inheritance and the part played by Prince Vasíli, it is very sad for both. Ah, my dear friend, our divine Saviour&amp;rsquo;s words, that it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God, are terribly true. I pity Prince Vasíli but am still more sorry for Pierre. So young, and burdened with such riches&amp;mdash;to what temptations he will be exposed! If I were asked what I desire most on earth, it would be to be poorer than the poorest beggar. A thousand thanks, dear friend, for the volume you have sent me and which has such success in Moscow. Yet since you tell me that among some good things it contains others which our weak human understanding cannot grasp, it seems to me rather useless to spend time in reading what is unintelligible and can therefore bear no fruit. I never could understand the fondness some people have for confusing their minds by dwelling on mystical books that merely awaken their doubts and excite their imagination, giving them a bent for exaggeration quite contrary to Christian simplicity. Let us rather read the Epistles and Gospels. Let us not seek to penetrate what mysteries they contain; for how can we, miserable sinners that we are, know the terrible and holy secrets of Providence while we remain in this flesh which forms an impenetrable veil between us and the Eternal? Let us rather confine ourselves to studying those sublime rules which our divine Saviour has left for our guidance here below. Let us try to conform to them and follow them, and let us be persuaded that the less we let our feeble human minds roam, the better we shall please God, who rejects all knowledge that does not come from Him; and the less we seek to fathom what He has been pleased to conceal from us, the sooner will He vouchsafe its revelation to us through His divine Spirit.</p>
    <p>My father has not spoken to me of a suitor, but has only told me that he has received a letter and is expecting a visit from Prince Vasíli. In regard to this project of marriage for me, I will tell you, dear sweet friend, that I look on marriage as a divine institution to which we must conform. However painful it may be to me, should the Almighty lay the duties of wife and mother upon me I shall try to perform them as faithfully as I can, without disquieting myself by examining my feelings toward him whom He may give me for husband.</p>
    <p>I have had a letter from my brother, who announces his speedy arrival at Bald Hills with his wife. This pleasure will be but a brief one, however, for he will leave us again to take part in this unhappy war into which we have been drawn, God knows how or why. Not only where you are&amp;mdash;at the heart of affairs and of the world&amp;mdash;is the talk all of war, even here amid fieldwork and the calm of nature&amp;mdash;which townsfolk consider characteristic of the country&amp;mdash;rumors of war are heard and painfully felt. My father talks of nothing but marches and countermarches, things of which I understand nothing; and the day before yesterday during my daily walk through the village I witnessed a heartrending scene.... It was a convoy of conscripts enrolled from our people and starting to join the army. You should have seen the state of the mothers, wives, and children of the men who were going and should have heard the sobs. It seems as though mankind has forgotten the laws of its divine Saviour, Who preached love and forgiveness of injuries&amp;mdash;and that men attribute the greatest merit to skill in killing one another.</p>
    <p>Adieu, dear and kind friend; may our divine Saviour and His most Holy Mother keep you in their holy and all-powerful care!</p>
    <p>MARY</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Ah, you are sending off a letter, Princess? I have already dispatched mine. I have written to my poor mother,&amp;rdquo; said the smiling Mademoiselle Bourienne rapidly, in her pleasant mellow tones and with guttural <i>r</i>&amp;rsquo;s. She brought into Princess Mary&amp;rsquo;s strenuous, mournful, and gloomy world a quite different atmosphere, careless, lighthearted, and self-satisfied.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Princess, I must warn you,&amp;rdquo; she added, lowering her voice and evidently listening to herself with pleasure, and speaking with exaggerated <i>grasseyement</i>, &amp;ldquo;the prince has been scolding Michael Ivánovich. He is in a very bad humor, very morose. Be prepared.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Ah, dear friend,&amp;rdquo; replied Princess Mary, &amp;ldquo;I have asked you never to warn me of the humor my father is in. I do not allow myself to judge him and would not have others do so.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The princess glanced at her watch and, seeing that she was five minutes late in starting her practice on the clavichord, went into the sitting room with a look of alarm. Between twelve and two o&amp;rsquo;clock, as the day was mapped out, the prince rested and the princess played the clavichord.</p>
    <h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
    <p>The gray-haired valet was sitting drowsily listening to the snoring of the prince, who was in his large study. From the far side of the house through the closed doors came the sound of difficult passages&amp;mdash;twenty times repeated&amp;mdash;of a sonata by Dussek.</p>
    <p>Just then a closed carriage and another with a hood drove up to the porch. Prince Andrew got out of the carriage, helped his little wife to alight, and let her pass into the house before him. Old Tíkhon, wearing a wig, put his head out of the door of the antechamber, reported in a whisper that the prince was sleeping, and hastily closed the door. Tíkhon knew that neither the son&amp;rsquo;s arrival nor any other unusual event must be allowed to disturb the appointed order of the day. Prince Andrew apparently knew this as well as Tíkhon; he looked at his watch as if to ascertain whether his father&amp;rsquo;s habits had changed since he was at home last, and, having assured himself that they had not, he turned to his wife.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;He will get up in twenty minutes. Let us go across to Mary&amp;rsquo;s room,&amp;rdquo; he said.</p>
    <p>The little princess had grown stouter during this time, but her eyes and her short, downy, smiling lip lifted when she began to speak just as merrily and prettily as ever.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Why, this is a palace!&amp;rdquo; she said to her husband, looking around with the expression with which people compliment their host at a ball. &amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s come, quick, quick!&amp;rdquo; And with a glance round, she smiled at Tíkhon, at her husband, and at the footman who accompanied them.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Is that Mary practicing? Let&amp;rsquo;s go quietly and take her by surprise.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Prince Andrew followed her with a courteous but sad expression.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;ve grown older, Tíkhon,&amp;rdquo; he said in passing to the old man, who kissed his hand.</p>
    <p>Before they reached the room from which the sounds of the clavichord came, the pretty, fair-haired Frenchwoman, Mademoiselle Bourienne, rushed out apparently beside herself with delight.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Ah! what joy for the princess!&amp;rdquo; exclaimed she: &amp;ldquo;At last! I must let her know.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;No, no, please not... You are Mademoiselle Bourienne,&amp;rdquo; said the little princess, kissing her. &amp;ldquo;I know you already through my sister-in-law&amp;rsquo;s friendship for you. She was not expecting us?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>They went up to the door of the sitting room from which came the sound of the oft-repeated passage of the sonata. Prince Andrew stopped and made a grimace, as if expecting something unpleasant.</p>
    <p>The little princess entered the room. The passage broke off in the middle, a cry was heard, then Princess Mary&amp;rsquo;s heavy tread and the sound of kissing. When Prince Andrew went in the two princesses, who had only met once before for a short time at his wedding, were in each other&amp;rsquo;s arms warmly pressing their lips to whatever place they happened to touch. Mademoiselle Bourienne stood near them pressing her hand to her heart, with a beatific smile and obviously equally ready to cry or to laugh. Prince Andrew shrugged his shoulders and frowned, as lovers of music do when they hear a false note. The two women let go of one another, and then, as if afraid of being too late, seized each other&amp;rsquo;s hands, kissing them and pulling them away, and again began kissing each other on the face, and then to Prince Andrew&amp;rsquo;s surprise both began to cry and kissed again. Mademoiselle Bourienne also began to cry. Prince Andrew evidently felt ill at ease, but to the two women it seemed quite natural that they should cry, and apparently it never entered their heads that it could have been otherwise at this meeting.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Ah! my dear!... Ah! Mary!...&amp;rdquo; they suddenly exclaimed, and then laughed. &amp;ldquo;I dreamed last night...&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;You were not expecting us?...&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Ah! Mary, you have got thinner?...&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;And you have grown stouter!...&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I knew the princess at once,&amp;rdquo; put in Mademoiselle Bourienne.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;And I had no idea!...&amp;rdquo; exclaimed Princess Mary. &amp;ldquo;Ah, Andrew, I did not see you.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Prince Andrew and his sister, hand in hand, kissed one another, and he told her she was still the same crybaby as ever. Princess Mary had turned toward her brother, and through her tears the loving, warm, gentle look of her large luminous eyes, very beautiful at that moment, rested on Prince Andrew&amp;rsquo;s face.</p>
    <p>The little princess talked incessantly, her short, downy upper lip continually and rapidly touching her rosy nether lip when necessary and drawing up again next moment when her face broke into a smile of glittering teeth and sparkling eyes. She told of an accident they had had on the Spásski Hill which might have been serious for her in her condition, and immediately after that informed them that she had left all her clothes in Petersburg and that heaven knew what she would have to dress in here; and that Andrew had quite changed, and that Kitty Odýntsova had married an old man, and that there was a suitor for Mary, a real one, but that they would talk of that later. Princess Mary was still looking silently at her brother and her beautiful eyes were full of love and sadness. It was plain that she was following a train of thought independent of her sister-in-law&amp;rsquo;s words. In the midst of a description of the last Petersburg fete she addressed her brother:</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;So you are really going to the war, Andrew?&amp;rdquo; she said sighing.</p>
    <p>Lise sighed too.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Yes, and even tomorrow,&amp;rdquo; replied her brother.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;He is leaving me here, God knows why, when he might have had promotion...&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Princess Mary did not listen to the end, but continuing her train of thought turned to her sister-in-law with a tender glance at her figure.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Is it certain?&amp;rdquo; she said.</p>
    <p>The face of the little princess changed. She sighed and said: &amp;ldquo;Yes, quite certain. Ah! it is very dreadful...&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Her lip descended. She brought her face close to her sister-in-law&amp;rsquo;s and unexpectedly again began to cry.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;She needs rest,&amp;rdquo; said Prince Andrew with a frown. &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t you, Lise? Take her to your room and I&amp;rsquo;ll go to Father. How is he? Just the same?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Yes, just the same. Though I don&amp;rsquo;t know what your opinion will be,&amp;rdquo; answered the princess joyfully.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;And are the hours the same? And the walks in the avenues? And the lathe?&amp;rdquo; asked Prince Andrew with a scarcely perceptible smile which showed that, in spite of all his love and respect for his father, he was aware of his weaknesses.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;The hours are the same, and the lathe, and also the mathematics and my geometry lessons,&amp;rdquo; said Princess Mary gleefully, as if her lessons in geometry were among the greatest delights of her life.</p>
    <p>When the twenty minutes had elapsed and the time had come for the old prince to get up, Tíkhon came to call the young prince to his father. The old man made a departure from his usual routine in honor of his son&amp;rsquo;s arrival: he gave orders to admit him to his apartments while he dressed for dinner. The old prince always dressed in old-fashioned style, wearing an antique coat and powdered hair; and when Prince Andrew entered his father&amp;rsquo;s dressing room (not with the contemptuous look and manner he wore in drawing rooms, but with the animated face with which he talked to Pierre), the old man was sitting on a large leather-covered chair, wrapped in a powdering mantle, entrusting his head to Tíkhon.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Ah! here&amp;rsquo;s the warrior! Wants to vanquish Buonaparte?&amp;rdquo; said the old man, shaking his powdered head as much as the tail, which Tíkhon was holding fast to plait, would allow.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;You at least must tackle him properly, or else if he goes on like this he&amp;rsquo;ll soon have us, too, for his subjects! How are you?&amp;rdquo; And he held out his cheek.</p>
    <p>The old man was in a good temper after his nap before dinner. (He used to say that a nap &amp;ldquo;after dinner was silver&amp;mdash;before dinner, golden.&amp;rdquo;) He cast happy, sidelong glances at his son from under his thick, bushy eyebrows. Prince Andrew went up and kissed his father on the spot indicated to him. He made no reply on his father&amp;rsquo;s favorite topic&amp;mdash;making fun of the military men of the day, and more particularly of Bonaparte.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Yes, Father, I have come to you and brought my wife who is pregnant,&amp;rdquo; said Prince Andrew, following every movement of his father&amp;rsquo;s face with an eager and respectful look. &amp;ldquo;How is your health?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Only fools and rakes fall ill, my boy. You know me: I am busy from morning till night and abstemious, so of course I am well.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Thank God,&amp;rdquo; said his son smiling.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;God has nothing to do with it! Well, go on,&amp;rdquo; he continued, returning to his hobby; &amp;ldquo;tell me how the Germans have taught you to fight Bonaparte by this new science you call &amp;lsquo;strategy.&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Prince Andrew smiled.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Give me time to collect my wits, Father,&amp;rdquo; said he, with a smile that showed that his father&amp;rsquo;s foibles did not prevent his son from loving and honoring him. &amp;ldquo;Why, I have not yet had time to settle down!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Nonsense, nonsense!&amp;rdquo; cried the old man, shaking his pigtail to see whether it was firmly plaited, and grasping his by the hand. &amp;ldquo;The house for your wife is ready. Princess Mary will take her there and show her over, and they&amp;rsquo;ll talk nineteen to the dozen. That&amp;rsquo;s their woman&amp;rsquo;s way! I am glad to have her. Sit down and talk. About Mikhelson&amp;rsquo;s army I understand&amp;mdash;Tolstóy &amp;lsquo;s too... a simultaneous expedition.... But what&amp;rsquo;s the southern army to do? Prussia is neutral... I know that. What about Austria?&amp;rdquo; said he, rising from his chair and pacing up and down the room followed by Tíkhon, who ran after him, handing him different articles of clothing. &amp;ldquo;What of Sweden? How will they cross Pomerania?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Prince Andrew, seeing that his father insisted, began&amp;mdash;at first reluctantly, but gradually with more and more animation, and from habit changing unconsciously from Russian to French as he went on&amp;mdash;to explain the plan of operation for the coming campaign. He explained how an army, ninety thousand strong, was to threaten Prussia so as to bring her out of her neutrality and draw her into the war; how part of that army was to join some Swedish forces at Stralsund; how two hundred and twenty thousand Austrians, with a hundred thousand Russians, were to operate in Italy and on the Rhine; how fifty thousand Russians and as many English were to land at Naples, and how a total force of five hundred thousand men was to attack the French from different sides. The old prince did not evince the least interest during this explanation, but as if he were not listening to it continued to dress while walking about, and three times unexpectedly interrupted. Once he stopped it by shouting: &amp;ldquo;The white one, the white one!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>This meant that Tíkhon was not handing him the waistcoat he wanted. Another time he interrupted, saying:</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;And will she soon be confined?&amp;rdquo; and shaking his head reproachfully said: &amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s bad! Go on, go on.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The third interruption came when Prince Andrew was finishing his description. The old man began to sing, in the cracked voice of old age: <i>&amp;ldquo;Malbrook s&amp;rsquo;en va-t-en guerre. Dieu sait quand reviendra.&amp;rdquo;</i> *</p>
    <pre class="testable">* &amp;ldquo;Marlborough is going to the wars; God knows when he&amp;rsquo;ll return.&amp;rdquo;</pre>
    <p>His son only smiled.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t say it&amp;rsquo;s a plan I approve of,&amp;rdquo; said the son; &amp;ldquo;I am only telling you what it is. Napoleon has also formed his plan by now, not worse than this one.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well, you&amp;rsquo;ve told me nothing new,&amp;rdquo; and the old man repeated, meditatively and rapidly:</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;<i>Dieu sait quand reviendra</i>. Go to the dining room.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
    <p>At the appointed hour the prince, powdered and shaven, entered the dining room where his daughter-in-law, Princess Mary, and Mademoiselle Bourienne were already awaiting him together with his architect, who by a strange caprice of his employer&amp;rsquo;s was admitted to table though the position of that insignificant individual was such as could certainly not have caused him to expect that honor. The prince, who generally kept very strictly to social distinctions and rarely admitted even important government officials to his table, had unexpectedly selected Michael Ivánovich (who always went into a corner to blow his nose on his checked handkerchief) to illustrate the theory that all men are equals, and had more than once impressed on his daughter that Michael Ivánovich was &amp;ldquo;not a whit worse than you or I.&amp;rdquo; At dinner the prince usually spoke to the taciturn Michael Ivánovich more often than to anyone else.</p>
    <p>In the dining room, which like all the rooms in the house was exceedingly lofty, the members of the household and the footmen&amp;mdash;one behind each chair&amp;mdash;stood waiting for the prince to enter. The head butler, napkin on arm, was scanning the setting of the table, making signs to the footmen, and anxiously glancing from the clock to the door by which the prince was to enter. Prince Andrew was looking at a large gilt frame, new to him, containing the genealogical tree of the Princes Bolkónski, opposite which hung another such frame with a badly painted portrait (evidently by the hand of the artist belonging to the estate) of a ruling prince, in a crown&amp;mdash;an alleged descendant of Rúrik and ancestor of the Bolkónskis. Prince Andrew, looking again at that genealogical tree, shook his head, laughing as a man laughs who looks at a portrait so characteristic of the original as to be amusing.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;How thoroughly like him that is!&amp;rdquo; he said to Princess Mary, who had come up to him.</p>
    <p>Princess Mary looked at her brother in surprise. She did not understand what he was laughing at. Everything her father did inspired her with reverence and was beyond question.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Everyone has his Achilles&amp;rsquo; heel,&amp;rdquo; continued Prince Andrew. &amp;ldquo;Fancy, with <i>his</i> powerful mind, indulging in such nonsense!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Princess Mary could not understand the boldness of her brother&amp;rsquo;s criticism and was about to reply, when the expected footsteps were heard coming from the study. The prince walked in quickly and jauntily as was his wont, as if intentionally contrasting the briskness of his manners with the strict formality of his house. At that moment the great clock struck two and another with a shrill tone joined in from the drawing room. The prince stood still; his lively glittering eyes from under their thick, bushy eyebrows sternly scanned all present and rested on the little princess. She felt, as courtiers do when the Tsar enters, the sensation of fear and respect which the old man inspired in all around him. He stroked her hair and then patted her awkwardly on the back of her neck.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m glad, glad, to see you,&amp;rdquo; he said, looking attentively into her eyes, and then quickly went to his place and sat down. &amp;ldquo;Sit down, sit down! Sit down, Michael Ivánovich!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>He indicated a place beside him to his daughter-in-law. A footman moved the chair for her.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Ho, ho!&amp;rdquo; said the old man, casting his eyes on her rounded figure. &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;ve been in a hurry. That&amp;rsquo;s bad!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>He laughed in his usual dry, cold, unpleasant way, with his lips only and not with his eyes.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;You must walk, walk as much as possible, as much as possible,&amp;rdquo; he said.</p>
    <p>The little princess did not, or did not wish to, hear his words. She was silent and seemed confused. The prince asked her about her father, and she began to smile and talk. He asked about mutual acquaintances, and she became still more animated and chattered away giving him greetings from various people and retelling the town gossip.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Countess Apráksina, poor thing, has lost her husband and she has cried her eyes out,&amp;rdquo; she said, growing more and more lively.</p>
    <p>As she became animated the prince looked at her more and more sternly, and suddenly, as if he had studied her sufficiently and had formed a definite idea of her, he turned away and addressed Michael Ivánovich.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well, Michael Ivánovich, our Bonaparte will be having a bad time of it. Prince Andrew&amp;rdquo; (he always spoke thus of his son) &amp;ldquo;has been telling me what forces are being collected against him! While you and I never thought much of him.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Michael Ivánovich did not at all know when &amp;ldquo;you and I&amp;rdquo; had said such things about Bonaparte, but understanding that he was wanted as a peg on which to hang the prince&amp;rsquo;s favorite topic, he looked inquiringly at the young prince, wondering what would follow.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;He is a great tactician!&amp;rdquo; said the prince to his son, pointing to the architect.</p>
    <p>And the conversation again turned on the war, on Bonaparte, and the generals and statesmen of the day. The old prince seemed convinced not only that all the men of the day were mere babies who did not know the A B C of war or of politics, and that Bonaparte was an insignificant little Frenchy, successful only because there were no longer any Potëmkins or Suvórovs left to oppose him; but he was also convinced that there were no political difficulties in Europe and no real war, but only a sort of puppet show at which the men of the day were playing, pretending to do something real. Prince Andrew gaily bore with his father&amp;rsquo;s ridicule of the new men, and drew him on and listened to him with evident pleasure.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;The past always seems good,&amp;rdquo; said he, &amp;ldquo;but did not Suvórov himself fall into a trap Moreau set him, and from which he did not know how to escape?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Who told you that? Who?&amp;rdquo; cried the prince. &amp;ldquo;Suvórov!&amp;rdquo; And he jerked away his plate, which Tíkhon briskly caught. &amp;ldquo;Suvórov!... Consider, Prince Andrew. Two... Frederick and Suvórov; Moreau!... Moreau would have been a prisoner if Suvórov had had a free hand; but he had the <i>Hofs-kriegs-wurst-schnapps-Rath</i> on his hands. It would have puzzled the devil himself! When you get there you&amp;rsquo;ll find out what those <i>Hofs-kriegs-wurst-Raths</i> are! Suvórov couldn&amp;rsquo;t manage them so what chance has Michael Kutúzov? No, my dear boy,&amp;rdquo; he continued, &amp;ldquo;you and your generals won&amp;rsquo;t get on against Buonaparte; you&amp;rsquo;ll have to call in the French, so that birds of a feather may fight together. The German, Pahlen, has been sent to New York in America, to fetch the Frenchman, Moreau,&amp;rdquo; he said, alluding to the invitation made that year to Moreau to enter the Russian service.... &amp;ldquo;Wonderful!... Were the Potëmkins, Suvórovs, and Orlóvs Germans? No, lad, either you fellows have all lost your wits, or I have outlived mine. May God help you, but we&amp;rsquo;ll see what will happen. Buonaparte has become a great commander among them! Hm!...&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t at all say that all the plans are good,&amp;rdquo; said Prince Andrew, &amp;ldquo;I am only surprised at your opinion of Bonaparte. You may laugh as much as you like, but all the same Bonaparte is a great general!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Michael Ivánovich!&amp;rdquo; cried the old prince to the architect who, busy with his roast meat, hoped he had been forgotten: &amp;ldquo;Didn&amp;rsquo;t I tell you Buonaparte was a great tactician? Here, he says the same thing.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;To be sure, your excellency,&amp;rdquo; replied the architect.</p>
    <p>The prince again laughed his frigid laugh.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Buonaparte was born with a silver spoon in his mouth. He has got splendid soldiers. Besides he began by attacking Germans. And only idlers have failed to beat the Germans. Since the world began everybody has beaten the Germans. They beat no one&amp;mdash;except one another. He made his reputation fighting them.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>And the prince began explaining all the blunders which, according to him, Bonaparte had made in his campaigns and even in politics. His son made no rejoinder, but it was evident that whatever arguments were presented he was as little able as his father to change his opinion. He listened, refraining from a reply, and involuntarily wondered how this old man, living alone in the country for so many years, could know and discuss so minutely and acutely all the recent European military and political events.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;You think I&amp;rsquo;m an old man and don&amp;rsquo;t understand the present state of affairs?&amp;rdquo; concluded his father. &amp;ldquo;But it troubles me. I don&amp;rsquo;t sleep at night. Come now, where has this great commander of yours shown his skill?&amp;rdquo; he concluded.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;That would take too long to tell,&amp;rdquo; answered the son.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well, then go off to your Buonaparte! Mademoiselle Bourienne, here&amp;rsquo;s another admirer of that powder-monkey emperor of yours,&amp;rdquo; he exclaimed in excellent French.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;You know, Prince, I am not a Bonapartist!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p><i>&amp;ldquo;Dieu sait quand reviendra.&amp;rdquo;</i> hummed the prince out of tune and, with a laugh still more so, he quitted the table.</p>
    <p>The little princess during the whole discussion and the rest of the dinner sat silent, glancing with a frightened look now at her father-in-law and now at Princess Mary. When they left the table she took her sister-in-law&amp;rsquo;s arm and drew her into another room.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;What a clever man your father is,&amp;rdquo; said she; &amp;ldquo;perhaps that is why I am afraid of him.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Oh, he is so kind!&amp;rdquo; answered Princess Mary.</p>
    <h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>
    <p>Prince Andrew was to leave next evening. The old prince, not altering his routine, retired as usual after dinner. The little princess was in her sister-in-law&amp;rsquo;s room. Prince Andrew in a traveling coat without epaulettes had been packing with his valet in the rooms assigned to him. After inspecting the carriage himself and seeing the trunks put in, he ordered the horses to be harnessed. Only those things he always kept with him remained in his room; a small box, a large canteen fitted with silver plate, two Turkish pistols and a saber&amp;mdash;a present from his father who had brought it from the siege of Ochákov. All these traveling effects of Prince Andrew&amp;rsquo;s were in very good order: new, clean, and in cloth covers carefully tied with tapes.</p>
    <p>When starting on a journey or changing their mode of life, men capable of reflection are generally in a serious frame of mind. At such moments one reviews the past and plans for the future. Prince Andrew&amp;rsquo;s face looked very thoughtful and tender. With his hands behind him he paced briskly from corner to corner of the room, looking straight before him and thoughtfully shaking his head. Did he fear going to the war, or was he sad at leaving his wife?&amp;mdash;perhaps both, but evidently he did not wish to be seen in that mood, for hearing footsteps in the passage he hurriedly unclasped his hands, stopped at a table as if tying the cover of the small box, and assumed his usual tranquil and impenetrable expression. It was the heavy tread of Princess Mary that he heard.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I hear you have given orders to harness,&amp;rdquo; she cried, panting (she had apparently been running), &amp;ldquo;and I did so wish to have another talk with you alone! God knows how long we may again be parted. You are not angry with me for coming? You have changed so, Andrúsha,&amp;rdquo; she added, as if to explain such a question.</p>
    <p>She smiled as she uttered his pet name, &amp;ldquo;Andrúsha.&amp;rdquo; It was obviously strange to her to think that this stern handsome man should be Andrúsha&amp;mdash;the slender mischievous boy who had been her playfellow in childhood.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;And where is Lise?&amp;rdquo; he asked, answering her question only by a smile.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;She was so tired that she has fallen asleep on the sofa in my room. Oh, Andrew! What a treasure of a wife you have,&amp;rdquo; said she, sitting down on the sofa, facing her brother. &amp;ldquo;She is quite a child: such a dear, merry child. I have grown so fond of her.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Prince Andrew was silent, but the princess noticed the ironical and contemptuous look that showed itself on his face.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;One must be indulgent to little weaknesses; who is free from them, Andrew? Don&amp;rsquo;t forget that she has grown up and been educated in society, and so her position now is not a rosy one. We should enter into everyone&amp;rsquo;s situation. <i>Tout comprendre, c&amp;rsquo;est tout pardonner</i>. * Think what it must be for her, poor thing, after what she has been used to, to be parted from her husband and be left alone in the country, in her condition! It&amp;rsquo;s very hard.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <pre class="testable">* To understand all is to forgive all.</pre>
    <p>Prince Andrew smiled as he looked at his sister, as we smile at those we think we thoroughly understand.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;You live in the country and don&amp;rsquo;t think the life terrible,&amp;rdquo; he replied.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I... that&amp;rsquo;s different. Why speak of me? I don&amp;rsquo;t want any other life, and can&amp;rsquo;t, for I know no other. But think, Andrew: for a young society woman to be buried in the country during the best years of her life, all alone&amp;mdash;for Papa is always busy, and I... well, you know what poor resources I have for entertaining a woman used to the best society. There is only Mademoiselle Bourienne....&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t like your Mademoiselle Bourienne at all,&amp;rdquo; said Prince Andrew.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;No? She is very nice and kind and, above all, she&amp;rsquo;s much to be pitied. She has no one, no one. To tell the truth, I don&amp;rsquo;t need her, and she&amp;rsquo;s even in my way. You know I always was a savage, and now am even more so. I like being alone.... Father likes her very much. She and Michael Ivánovich are the two people to whom he is always gentle and kind, because he has been a benefactor to them both. As Sterne says: &amp;lsquo;We don&amp;rsquo;t love people so much for the good they have done us, as for the good we have done them.&amp;rsquo; Father took her when she was homeless after losing her own father. She is very good-natured, and my father likes her way of reading. She reads to him in the evenings and reads splendidly.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;To be quite frank, Mary, I expect Father&amp;rsquo;s character sometimes makes things trying for you, doesn&amp;rsquo;t it?&amp;rdquo; Prince Andrew asked suddenly.</p>
    <p>Princess Mary was first surprised and then aghast at this question.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;For me? For me?... Trying for me!...&amp;rdquo; said she.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;He always was rather harsh; and now I should think he&amp;rsquo;s getting very trying,&amp;rdquo; said Prince Andrew, apparently speaking lightly of their father in order to puzzle or test his sister.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;You are good in every way, Andrew, but you have a kind of intellectual pride,&amp;rdquo; said the princess, following the train of her own thoughts rather than the trend of the conversation&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;and that&amp;rsquo;s a great sin. How can one judge Father? But even if one might, what feeling except veneration could such a man as my father evoke? And I am so contented and happy with him. I only wish you were all as happy as I am.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Her brother shook his head incredulously.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;The only thing that is hard for me... I will tell you the truth, Andrew... is Father&amp;rsquo;s way of treating religious subjects. I don&amp;rsquo;t understand how a man of his immense intellect can fail to see what is as clear as day, and can go so far astray. That is the only thing that makes me unhappy. But even in this I can see lately a shade of improvement. His satire has been less bitter of late, and there was a monk he received and had a long talk with.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Ah! my dear, I am afraid you and your monk are wasting your powder,&amp;rdquo; said Prince Andrew banteringly yet tenderly.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Ah! <i>mon ami</i>, I only pray, and hope that God will hear me. Andrew...&amp;rdquo; she said timidly after a moment&amp;rsquo;s silence, &amp;ldquo;I have a great favor to ask of you.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;What is it, dear?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;No&amp;mdash;promise that you will not refuse! It will give you no trouble and is nothing unworthy of you, but it will comfort me. Promise, Andrúsha!...&amp;rdquo; said she, putting her hand in her reticule but not yet taking out what she was holding inside it, as if what she held were the subject of her request and must not be shown before the request was granted.</p>
    <p>She looked timidly at her brother.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Even if it were a great deal of trouble...&amp;rdquo; answered Prince Andrew, as if guessing what it was about.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Think what you please! I know you are just like Father. Think as you please, but do this for my sake! Please do! Father&amp;rsquo;s father, our grandfather, wore it in all his wars.&amp;rdquo; (She still did not take out what she was holding in her reticule.) &amp;ldquo;So you promise?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Of course. What is it?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Andrew, I bless you with this icon and you must promise me you will never take it off. Do you promise?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;If it does not weigh a hundredweight and won&amp;rsquo;t break my neck... To please you...&amp;rdquo; said Prince Andrew. But immediately, noticing the pained expression his joke had brought to his sister&amp;rsquo;s face, he repented and added: &amp;ldquo;I am glad; really, dear, I am very glad.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Against your will He will save and have mercy on you and bring you to Himself, for in Him alone is truth and peace,&amp;rdquo; said she in a voice trembling with emotion, solemnly holding up in both hands before her brother a small, oval, antique, dark-faced icon of the Saviour in a gold setting, on a finely wrought silver chain.</p>
    <p>She crossed herself, kissed the icon, and handed it to Andrew.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Please, Andrew, for my sake!...&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Rays of gentle light shone from her large, timid eyes. Those eyes lit up the whole of her thin, sickly face and made it beautiful. Her brother would have taken the icon, but she stopped him. Andrew understood, crossed himself and kissed the icon. There was a look of tenderness, for he was touched, but also a gleam of irony on his face.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Thank you, my dear.&amp;rdquo; She kissed him on the forehead and sat down again on the sofa. They were silent for a while.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;As I was saying to you, Andrew, be kind and generous as you always used to be. Don&amp;rsquo;t judge Lise harshly,&amp;rdquo; she began. &amp;ldquo;She is so sweet, so good-natured, and her position now is a very hard one.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I do not think I have complained of my wife to you, Másha, or blamed her. Why do you say all this to me?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Red patches appeared on Princess Mary&amp;rsquo;s face and she was silent as if she felt guilty.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I have said nothing to you, but you have already been talked to. And I am sorry for that,&amp;rdquo; he went on.</p>
    <p>The patches grew deeper on her forehead, neck, and cheeks. She tried to say something but could not. Her brother had guessed right: the little princess had been crying after dinner and had spoken of her forebodings about her confinement, and how she dreaded it, and had complained of her fate, her father-in-law, and her husband. After crying she had fallen asleep. Prince Andrew felt sorry for his sister.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Know this, Másha: I can&amp;rsquo;t reproach, have not reproached, and never shall reproach <i>my wife</i> with anything, and I cannot reproach myself with anything in regard to her; and that always will be so in whatever circumstances I may be placed. But if you want to know the truth... if you want to know whether I am happy? No! Is she happy? No! But why this is so I don&amp;rsquo;t know...&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>As he said this he rose, went to his sister, and, stooping, kissed her forehead. His fine eyes lit up with a thoughtful, kindly, and unaccustomed brightness, but he was looking not at his sister but over her head toward the darkness of the open doorway.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Let us go to her, I must say good-by. Or&amp;mdash;go and wake and I&amp;rsquo;ll come in a moment. Petrúshka!&amp;rdquo; he called to his valet: &amp;ldquo;Come here, take these away. Put this on the seat and this to the right.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Princess Mary rose and moved to the door, then stopped and said: &amp;ldquo;Andrew, if you had faith you would have turned to God and asked Him to give you the love you do not feel, and your prayer would have been answered.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well, maybe!&amp;rdquo; said Prince Andrew. &amp;ldquo;Go, Másha; I&amp;rsquo;ll come immediately.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>On the way to his sister&amp;rsquo;s room, in the passage which connected one wing with the other, Prince Andrew met Mademoiselle Bourienne smiling sweetly. It was the third time that day that, with an ecstatic and artless smile, she had met him in secluded passages.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Oh! I thought you were in your room,&amp;rdquo; she said, for some reason blushing and dropping her eyes.</p>
    <p>Prince Andrew looked sternly at her and an expression of anger suddenly came over his face. He said nothing to her but looked at her forehead and hair, without looking at her eyes, with such contempt that the Frenchwoman blushed and went away without a word. When he reached his sister&amp;rsquo;s room his wife was already awake and her merry voice, hurrying one word after another, came through the open door. She was speaking as usual in French, and as if after long self-restraint she wished to make up for lost time.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;No, but imagine the old Countess Zúbova, with false curls and her mouth full of false teeth, as if she were trying to cheat old age.... Ha, ha, ha! Mary!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>This very sentence about Countess Zúbova and this same laugh Prince Andrew had already heard from his wife in the presence of others some five times. He entered the room softly. The little princess, plump and rosy, was sitting in an easy chair with her work in her hands, talking incessantly, repeating Petersburg reminiscences and even phrases. Prince Andrew came up, stroked her hair, and asked if she felt rested after their journey. She answered him and continued her chatter.</p>
    <p>The coach with six horses was waiting at the porch. It was an autumn night, so dark that the coachman could not see the carriage pole. Servants with lanterns were bustling about in the porch. The immense house was brilliant with lights shining through its lofty windows. The domestic serfs were crowding in the hall, waiting to bid good-by to the young prince. The members of the household were all gathered in the reception hall: Michael Ivánovich, Mademoiselle Bourienne, Princess Mary, and the little princess. Prince Andrew had been called to his father&amp;rsquo;s study as the latter wished to say good-by to him alone. All were waiting for them to come out.</p>
    <p>When Prince Andrew entered the study the old man in his old-age spectacles and white dressing gown, in which he received no one but his son, sat at the table writing. He glanced round.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Going?&amp;rdquo; And he went on writing.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve come to say good-by.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Kiss me here,&amp;rdquo; and he touched his cheek: &amp;ldquo;Thanks, thanks!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;What do you thank me for?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;For not dilly-dallying and not hanging to a woman&amp;rsquo;s apron strings. The Service before everything. Thanks, thanks!&amp;rdquo; And he went on writing, so that his quill spluttered and squeaked. &amp;ldquo;If you have anything to say, say it. These two things can be done together,&amp;rdquo; he added.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;About my wife... I am ashamed as it is to leave her on your hands....&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Why talk nonsense? Say what you want.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;When her confinement is due, send to Moscow for an <i>accoucheur</i>.... Let him be here....&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The old prince stopped writing and, as if not understanding, fixed his stern eyes on his son.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I know that no one can help if nature does not do her work,&amp;rdquo; said Prince Andrew, evidently confused. &amp;ldquo;I know that out of a million cases only one goes wrong, but it is her fancy and mine. They have been telling her things. She has had a dream and is frightened.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Hm... Hm...&amp;rdquo; muttered the old prince to himself, finishing what he was writing. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll do it.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>He signed with a flourish and suddenly turning to his son began to laugh.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s a bad business, eh?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;What is bad, Father?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;The wife!&amp;rdquo; said the old prince, briefly and significantly.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t understand!&amp;rdquo; said Prince Andrew.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;No, it can&amp;rsquo;t be helped, lad,&amp;rdquo; said the prince. &amp;ldquo;They&amp;rsquo;re all like that; one can&amp;rsquo;t unmarry. Don&amp;rsquo;t be afraid; I won&amp;rsquo;t tell anyone, but you know it yourself.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>He seized his son by the hand with small bony fingers, shook it, looked straight into his son&amp;rsquo;s face with keen eyes which seemed to see through him, and again laughed his frigid laugh.</p>
    <p>The son sighed, thus admitting that his father had understood him. The old man continued to fold and seal his letter, snatching up and throwing down the wax, the seal, and the paper, with his accustomed rapidity.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s to be done? She&amp;rsquo;s pretty! I will do everything. Make your mind easy,&amp;rdquo; said he in abrupt sentences while sealing his letter.</p>
    <p>Andrew did not speak; he was both pleased and displeased that his father understood him. The old man got up and gave the letter to his son.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Listen!&amp;rdquo; said he; &amp;ldquo;don&amp;rsquo;t worry about your wife: what can be done shall be. Now listen! Give this letter to Michael Ilariónovich. * I have written that he should make use of you in proper places and not keep you long as an adjutant: a bad position! Tell him I remember and like him. Write and tell me how he receives you. If he is all right&amp;mdash;serve him. Nicholas Bolkónski&amp;rsquo;s son need not serve under anyone if he is in disfavor. Now come here.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <pre class="testable">*Kutúzov.</pre>
    <p>He spoke so rapidly that he did not finish half his words, but his son was accustomed to understand him. He led him to the desk, raised the lid, drew out a drawer, and took out an exercise book filled with his bold, tall, close handwriting.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I shall probably die before you. So remember, these are my memoirs; hand them to the Emperor after my death. Now here is a Lombard bond and a letter; it is a premium for the man who writes a history of Suvórov&amp;rsquo;s wars. Send it to the Academy. Here are some jottings for you to read when I am gone. You will find them useful.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Andrew did not tell his father that he would no doubt live a long time yet. He felt that he must not say it.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I will do it all, Father,&amp;rdquo; he said.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well, now, good-by!&amp;rdquo; He gave his son his hand to kiss, and embraced him. &amp;ldquo;Remember this, Prince Andrew, if they kill you it will hurt me, your old father...&amp;rdquo; he paused unexpectedly, and then in a querulous voice suddenly shrieked: &amp;ldquo;but if I hear that you have not behaved like a son of Nicholas Bolkónski, I shall be ashamed!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;You need not have said that to me, Father,&amp;rdquo; said the son with a smile.</p>
    <p>The old man was silent.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I also wanted to ask you,&amp;rdquo; continued Prince Andrew, &amp;ldquo;if I&amp;rsquo;m killed and if I have a son, do not let him be taken away from you&amp;mdash;as I said yesterday... let him grow up with you.... Please.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Not let the wife have him?&amp;rdquo; said the old man, and laughed.</p>
    <p>They stood silent, facing one another. The old man&amp;rsquo;s sharp eyes were fixed straight on his son&amp;rsquo;s. Something twitched in the lower part of the old prince&amp;rsquo;s face.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ve said good-by. Go!&amp;rdquo; he suddenly shouted in a loud, angry voice, opening his door.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;What is it? What?&amp;rdquo; asked both princesses when they saw for a moment at the door Prince Andrew and the figure of the old man in a white dressing gown, spectacled and wigless, shouting in an angry voice.</p>
    <p>Prince Andrew sighed and made no reply.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well!&amp;rdquo; he said, turning to his wife.</p>
    <p>And this &amp;ldquo;Well!&amp;rdquo; sounded coldly ironic, as if he were saying: &amp;ldquo;Now go through your performance.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Andrew, already!&amp;rdquo; said the little princess, turning pale and looking with dismay at her husband.</p>
    <p>He embraced her. She screamed and fell unconscious on his shoulder.</p>
    <p>He cautiously released the shoulder she leaned on, looked into her face, and carefully placed her in an easy chair.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Adieu, Mary,&amp;rdquo; said he gently to his sister, taking her by the hand and kissing her, and then he left the room with rapid steps.</p>
    <p>The little princess lay in the armchair, Mademoiselle Bourienne chafing her temples. Princess Mary, supporting her sister-in-law, still looked with her beautiful eyes full of tears at the door through which Prince Andrew had gone and made the sign of the cross in his direction. From the study, like pistol shots, came the frequent sound of the old man angrily blowing his nose. Hardly had Prince Andrew gone when the study door opened quickly and the stern figure of the old man in the white dressing gown looked out.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Gone? That&amp;rsquo;s all right!&amp;rdquo; said he; and looking angrily at the unconscious little princess, he shook his head reprovingly and slammed the door.</p>
    <h2>BOOK TWO: 1805</h2>
    <h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
    <p>In October, 1805, a Russian army was occupying the villages and towns of the Archduchy of Austria, and yet other regiments freshly arriving from Russia were settling near the fortress of Braunau and burdening the inhabitants on whom they were quartered. Braunau was the headquarters of the commander in chief, Kutúzov.</p>
    <p>On October 11, 1805, one of the infantry regiments that had just reached Braunau had halted half a mile from the town, waiting to be inspected by the commander in chief. Despite the un-Russian appearance of the locality and surroundings&amp;mdash;fruit gardens, stone fences, tiled roofs, and hills in the distance&amp;mdash;and despite the fact that the inhabitants (who gazed with curiosity at the soldiers) were not Russians, the regiment had just the appearance of any Russian regiment preparing for an inspection anywhere in the heart of Russia.</p>
    <p>On the evening of the last day&amp;rsquo;s march an order had been received that the commander in chief would inspect the regiment on the march. Though the words of the order were not clear to the regimental commander, and the question arose whether the troops were to be in marching order or not, it was decided at a consultation between the battalion commanders to present the regiment in parade order, on the principle that it is always better to &amp;ldquo;bow too low than not bow low enough.&amp;rdquo; So the soldiers, after a twenty-mile march, were kept mending and cleaning all night long without closing their eyes, while the adjutants and company commanders calculated and reckoned, and by morning the regiment&amp;mdash;instead of the straggling, disorderly crowd it had been on its last march the day before&amp;mdash;presented a well-ordered array of two thousand men each of whom knew his place and his duty, had every button and every strap in place, and shone with cleanliness. And not only externally was all in order, but had it pleased the commander in chief to look under the uniforms he would have found on every man a clean shirt, and in every knapsack the appointed number of articles, &amp;ldquo;awl, soap, and all,&amp;rdquo; as the soldiers say. There was only one circumstance concerning which no one could be at ease. It was the state of the soldiers&amp;rsquo; boots. More than half the men&amp;rsquo;s boots were in holes. But this defect was not due to any fault of the regimental commander, for in spite of repeated demands boots had not been issued by the Austrian commissariat, and the regiment had marched some seven hundred miles.</p>
    <p>The commander of the regiment was an elderly, choleric, stout, and thick-set general with grizzled eyebrows and whiskers, and wider from chest to back than across the shoulders. He had on a brand-new uniform showing the creases where it had been folded and thick gold epaulettes which seemed to stand rather than lie down on his massive shoulders. He had the air of a man happily performing one of the most solemn duties of his life. He walked about in front of the line and at every step pulled himself up, slightly arching his back. It was plain that the commander admired his regiment, rejoiced in it, and that his whole mind was engrossed by it, yet his strut seemed to indicate that, besides military matters, social interests and the fair sex occupied no small part of his thoughts.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well, Michael Mítrich, sir?&amp;rdquo; he said, addressing one of the battalion commanders who smilingly pressed forward (it was plain that they both felt happy). &amp;ldquo;We had our hands full last night. However, I think the regiment is not a bad one, eh?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The battalion commander perceived the jovial irony and laughed.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;It would not be turned off the field even on the Tsarítsin Meadow.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;What?&amp;rdquo; asked the commander.</p>
    <p>At that moment, on the road from the town on which signalers had been posted, two men appeared on horse back. They were an aide-de-camp followed by a Cossack.</p>
    <p>The aide-de-camp was sent to confirm the order which had not been clearly worded the day before, namely, that the commander in chief wished to see the regiment just in the state in which it had been on the march: in their greatcoats, and packs, and without any preparation whatever.</p>
    <p>A member of the Hofkriegsrath from Vienna had come to Kutúzov the day before with proposals and demands for him to join up with the army of the Archduke Ferdinand and Mack, and Kutúzov, not considering this junction advisable, meant, among other arguments in support of his view, to show the Austrian general the wretched state in which the troops arrived from Russia. With this object he intended to meet the regiment; so the worse the condition it was in, the better pleased the commander in chief would be. Though the aide-de-camp did not know these circumstances, he nevertheless delivered the definite order that the men should be in their greatcoats and in marching order, and that the commander in chief would otherwise be dissatisfied. On hearing this the regimental commander hung his head, silently shrugged his shoulders, and spread out his arms with a choleric gesture.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;A fine mess we&amp;rsquo;ve made of it!&amp;rdquo; he remarked.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;There now! Didn&amp;rsquo;t I tell you, Michael Mítrich, that if it was said &amp;lsquo;on the march&amp;rsquo; it meant in greatcoats?&amp;rdquo; said he reproachfully to the battalion commander. &amp;ldquo;Oh, my God!&amp;rdquo; he added, stepping resolutely forward. &amp;ldquo;Company commanders!&amp;rdquo; he shouted in a voice accustomed to command. &amp;ldquo;Sergeants major!... How soon will he be here?&amp;rdquo; he asked the aide-de-camp with a respectful politeness evidently relating to the personage he was referring to.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;In an hour&amp;rsquo;s time, I should say.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Shall we have time to change clothes?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know, General....&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The regimental commander, going up to the line himself, ordered the soldiers to change into their greatcoats. The company commanders ran off to their companies, the sergeants major began bustling (the greatcoats were not in very good condition), and instantly the squares that had up to then been in regular order and silent began to sway and stretch and hum with voices. On all sides soldiers were running to and fro, throwing up their knapsacks with a jerk of their shoulders and pulling the straps over their heads, unstrapping their overcoats and drawing the sleeves on with upraised arms.</p>
    <p>In half an hour all was again in order, only the squares had become gray instead of black. The regimental commander walked with his jerky steps to the front of the regiment and examined it from a distance.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Whatever is this? This!&amp;rdquo; he shouted and stood still. &amp;ldquo;Commander of the third company!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Commander of the third company wanted by the general!... commander to the general... third company to the commander.&amp;rdquo; The words passed along the lines and an adjutant ran to look for the missing officer.</p>
    <p>When the eager but misrepeated words had reached their destination in a cry of: &amp;ldquo;The general to the third company,&amp;rdquo; the missing officer appeared from behind his company and, though he was a middle-aged man and not in the habit of running, trotted awkwardly stumbling on his toes toward the general. The captain&amp;rsquo;s face showed the uneasiness of a schoolboy who is told to repeat a lesson he has not learned. Spots appeared on his nose, the redness of which was evidently due to intemperance, and his mouth twitched nervously. The general looked the captain up and down as he came up panting, slackening his pace as he approached.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;You will soon be dressing your men in petticoats! What is this?&amp;rdquo; shouted the regimental commander, thrusting forward his jaw and pointing at a soldier in the ranks of the third company in a greatcoat of bluish cloth, which contrasted with the others. &amp;ldquo;What have you been after? The commander in chief is expected and you leave your place? Eh? I&amp;rsquo;ll teach you to dress the men in fancy coats for a parade.... Eh...?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The commander of the company, with his eyes fixed on his superior, pressed two fingers more and more rigidly to his cap, as if in this pressure lay his only hope of salvation.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well, why don&amp;rsquo;t you speak? Whom have you got there dressed up as a Hungarian?&amp;rdquo; said the commander with an austere gibe.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Your excellency...&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well, your excellency, what? Your excellency! But what about your excellency?... nobody knows.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Your excellency, it&amp;rsquo;s the officer Dólokhov, who has been reduced to the ranks,&amp;rdquo; said the captain softly.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well? Has he been degraded into a field marshal, or into a soldier? If a soldier, he should be dressed in regulation uniform like the others.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Your excellency, you gave him leave yourself, on the march.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Gave him leave? Leave? That&amp;rsquo;s just like you young men,&amp;rdquo; said the regimental commander cooling down a little. &amp;ldquo;Leave indeed.... One says a word to you and you... What?&amp;rdquo; he added with renewed irritation, &amp;ldquo;I beg you to dress your men decently.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>And the commander, turning to look at the adjutant, directed his jerky steps down the line. He was evidently pleased at his own display of anger and walking up to the regiment wished to find a further excuse for wrath. Having snapped at an officer for an unpolished badge, at another because his line was not straight, he reached the third company.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;H-o-o-w are you standing? Where&amp;rsquo;s your leg? Your leg?&amp;rdquo; shouted the commander with a tone of suffering in his voice, while there were still five men between him and Dólokhov with his bluish-gray uniform.</p>
    <p>Dólokhov slowly straightened his bent knee, looking straight with his clear, insolent eyes in the general&amp;rsquo;s face.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Why a blue coat? Off with it... Sergeant major! Change his coat... the ras...&amp;rdquo; he did not finish.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;General, I must obey orders, but I am not bound to endure...&amp;rdquo; Dólokhov hurriedly interrupted.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;No talking in the ranks!... No talking, no talking!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Not bound to endure insults,&amp;rdquo; Dólokhov concluded in loud, ringing tones.</p>
    <p>The eyes of the general and the soldier met. The general became silent, angrily pulling down his tight scarf.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I request you to have the goodness to change your coat,&amp;rdquo; he said as he turned away.</p>
    <h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;He&amp;rsquo;s coming!&amp;rdquo; shouted the signaler at that moment.</p>
    <p>The regimental commander, flushing, ran to his horse, seized the stirrup with trembling hands, threw his body across the saddle, righted himself, drew his saber, and with a happy and resolute countenance, opening his mouth awry, prepared to shout. The regiment fluttered like a bird preening its plumage and became motionless.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Att-ention!&amp;rdquo; shouted the regimental commander in a soul-shaking voice which expressed joy for himself, severity for the regiment, and welcome for the approaching chief.</p>
    <p>Along the broad country road, edged on both sides by trees, came a high, light blue Viennese <i>calèche</i>, slightly creaking on its springs and drawn by six horses at a smart trot. Behind the <i>calèche</i> galloped the suite and a convoy of Croats. Beside Kutúzov sat an Austrian general, in a white uniform that looked strange among the Russian black ones. The <i>calèche</i> stopped in front of the regiment. Kutúzov and the Austrian general were talking in low voices and Kutúzov smiled slightly as treading heavily he stepped down from the carriage just as if those two thousand men breathlessly gazing at him and the regimental commander did not exist.</p>
    <p>The word of command rang out, and again the regiment quivered, as with a jingling sound it presented arms. Then amidst a dead silence the feeble voice of the commander in chief was heard. The regiment roared, &amp;ldquo;Health to your ex... len... len... lency!&amp;rdquo; and again all became silent. At first Kutúzov stood still while the regiment moved; then he and the general in white, accompanied by the suite, walked between the ranks.</p>
    <p>From the way the regimental commander saluted the commander in chief and devoured him with his eyes, drawing himself up obsequiously, and from the way he walked through the ranks behind the generals, bending forward and hardly able to restrain his jerky movements, and from the way he darted forward at every word or gesture of the commander in chief, it was evident that he performed his duty as a subordinate with even greater zeal than his duty as a commander. Thanks to the strictness and assiduity of its commander the regiment, in comparison with others that had reached Braunau at the same time, was in splendid condition. There were only 217 sick and stragglers. Everything was in good order except the boots.</p>
    <p>Kutúzov walked through the ranks, sometimes stopping to say a few friendly words to officers he had known in the Turkish war, sometimes also to the soldiers. Looking at their boots he several times shook his head sadly, pointing them out to the Austrian general with an expression which seemed to say that he was not blaming anyone, but could not help noticing what a bad state of things it was. The regimental commander ran forward on each such occasion, fearing to miss a single word of the commander in chief&amp;rsquo;s regarding the regiment. Behind Kutúzov, at a distance that allowed every softly spoken word to be heard, followed some twenty men of his suite. These gentlemen talked among themselves and sometimes laughed. Nearest of all to the commander in chief walked a handsome adjutant. This was Prince Bolkónski. Beside him was his comrade Nesvítski, a tall staff officer, extremely stout, with a kindly, smiling, handsome face and moist eyes. Nesvítski could hardly keep from laughter provoked by a swarthy hussar officer who walked beside him. This hussar, with a grave face and without a smile or a change in the expression of his fixed eyes, watched the regimental commander&amp;rsquo;s back and mimicked his every movement. Each time the commander started and bent forward, the hussar started and bent forward in exactly the same manner. Nesvítski laughed and nudged the others to make them look at the wag.</p>
    <p>Kutúzov walked slowly and languidly past thousands of eyes which were starting from their sockets to watch their chief. On reaching the third company he suddenly stopped. His suite, not having expected this, involuntarily came closer to him.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Ah, Timókhin!&amp;rdquo; said he, recognizing the red-nosed captain who had been reprimanded on account of the blue greatcoat.</p>
    <p>One would have thought it impossible for a man to stretch himself more than Timókhin had done when he was reprimanded by the regimental commander, but now that the commander in chief addressed him he drew himself up to such an extent that it seemed he could not have sustained it had the commander in chief continued to look at him, and so Kutúzov, who evidently understood his case and wished him nothing but good, quickly turned away, a scarcely perceptible smile flitting over his scarred and puffy face.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Another Ismail comrade,&amp;rdquo; said he. &amp;ldquo;A brave officer! Are you satisfied with him?&amp;rdquo; he asked the regimental commander.</p>
    <p>And the latter&amp;mdash;unconscious that he was being reflected in the hussar officer as in a looking glass&amp;mdash;started, moved forward, and answered: &amp;ldquo;Highly satisfied, your excellency!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;We all have our weaknesses,&amp;rdquo; said Kutúzov smiling and walking away from him. &amp;ldquo;He used to have a predilection for Bacchus.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The regimental commander was afraid he might be blamed for this and did not answer. The hussar at that moment noticed the face of the red-nosed captain and his drawn-in stomach, and mimicked his expression and pose with such exactitude that Nesvítski could not help laughing. Kutúzov turned round. The officer evidently had complete control of his face, and while Kutúzov was turning managed to make a grimace and then assume a most serious, deferential, and innocent expression.</p>
    <p>The third company was the last, and Kutúzov pondered, apparently trying to recollect something. Prince Andrew stepped forward from among the suite and said in French:</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;You told me to remind you of the officer Dólokhov, reduced to the ranks in this regiment.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Where is Dólokhov?&amp;rdquo; asked Kutúzov.</p>
    <p>Dólokhov, who had already changed into a soldier&amp;rsquo;s gray greatcoat, did not wait to be called. The shapely figure of the fair-haired soldier, with his clear blue eyes, stepped forward from the ranks, went up to the commander in chief, and presented arms.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Have you a complaint to make?&amp;rdquo; Kutúzov asked with a slight frown.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;This is Dólokhov,&amp;rdquo; said Prince Andrew.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Ah!&amp;rdquo; said Kutúzov. &amp;ldquo;I hope this will be a lesson to you. Do your duty. The Emperor is gracious, and I shan&amp;rsquo;t forget you if you deserve well.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The clear blue eyes looked at the commander in chief just as boldly as they had looked at the regimental commander, seeming by their expression to tear open the veil of convention that separates a commander in chief so widely from a private.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;One thing I ask of your excellency,&amp;rdquo; Dólokhov said in his firm, ringing, deliberate voice. &amp;ldquo;I ask an opportunity to atone for my fault and prove my devotion to His Majesty the Emperor and to Russia!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Kutúzov turned away. The same smile of the eyes with which he had turned from Captain Timókhin again flitted over his face. He turned away with a grimace as if to say that everything Dólokhov had said to him and everything he could say had long been known to him, that he was weary of it and it was not at all what he wanted. He turned away and went to the carriage.</p>
    <p>The regiment broke up into companies, which went to their appointed quarters near Braunau, where they hoped to receive boots and clothes and to rest after their hard marches.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;You won&amp;rsquo;t bear me a grudge, Prokhór Ignátych?&amp;rdquo; said the regimental commander, overtaking the third company on its way to its quarters and riding up to Captain Timókhin who was walking in front. (The regimental commander&amp;rsquo;s face now that the inspection was happily over beamed with irrepressible delight.) &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s in the Emperor&amp;rsquo;s service... it can&amp;rsquo;t be helped... one is sometimes a bit hasty on parade... I am the first to apologize, you know me!... He was very pleased!&amp;rdquo; And he held out his hand to the captain.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t mention it, General, as if I&amp;rsquo;d be so bold!&amp;rdquo; replied the captain, his nose growing redder as he gave a smile which showed where two front teeth were missing that had been knocked out by the butt end of a gun at Ismail.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;And tell Mr. Dólokhov that I won&amp;rsquo;t forget him&amp;mdash;he may be quite easy. And tell me, please&amp;mdash;I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to ask&amp;mdash;how is he behaving himself, and in general...&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;As far as the service goes he is quite punctilious, your excellency; but his character...&amp;rdquo; said Timókhin.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;And what about his character?&amp;rdquo; asked the regimental commander.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s different on different days,&amp;rdquo; answered the captain. &amp;ldquo;One day he is sensible, well educated, and good-natured, and the next he&amp;rsquo;s a wild beast.... In Poland, if you please, he nearly killed a Jew.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Oh, well, well!&amp;rdquo; remarked the regimental commander. &amp;ldquo;Still, one must have pity on a young man in misfortune. You know he has important connections... Well, then, you just...&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I will, your excellency,&amp;rdquo; said Timókhin, showing by his smile that he understood his commander&amp;rsquo;s wish.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well, of course, of course!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The regimental commander sought out Dólokhov in the ranks and, reining in his horse, said to him:</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;After the next affair... epaulettes.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Dólokhov looked round but did not say anything, nor did the mocking smile on his lips change.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well, that&amp;rsquo;s all right,&amp;rdquo; continued the regimental commander. &amp;ldquo;A cup of vodka for the men from me,&amp;rdquo; he added so that the soldiers could hear. &amp;ldquo;I thank you all! God be praised!&amp;rdquo; and he rode past that company and overtook the next one.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well, he&amp;rsquo;s really a good fellow, one can serve under him,&amp;rdquo; said Timókhin to the subaltern beside him.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;In a word, a hearty one...&amp;rdquo; said the subaltern, laughing (the regimental commander was nicknamed <i>King of Hearts</i>).</p>
    <p>The cheerful mood of their officers after the inspection infected the soldiers. The company marched on gaily. The soldiers&amp;rsquo; voices could be heard on every side.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;And they said Kutúzov was blind of one eye?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;And so he is! Quite blind!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;No, friend, he is sharper-eyed than you are. Boots and leg bands... he noticed everything...&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;When he looked at my feet, friend... well, thinks I...&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;And that other one with him, the Austrian, looked as if he were smeared with chalk&amp;mdash;as white as flour! I suppose they polish him up as they do the guns.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I say, Fédeshon!... Did he say when the battles are to begin? You were near him. Everybody said that Buonaparte himself was at Braunau.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Buonaparte himself!... Just listen to the fool, what he doesn&amp;rsquo;t know! The Prussians are up in arms now. The Austrians, you see, are putting them down. When they&amp;rsquo;ve been put down, the war with Buonaparte will begin. And he says Buonaparte is in Braunau! Shows you&amp;rsquo;re a fool. You&amp;rsquo;d better listen more carefully!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;What devils these quartermasters are! See, the fifth company is turning into the village already... they will have their buckwheat cooked before we reach our quarters.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Give me a biscuit, you devil!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;And did you give me tobacco yesterday? That&amp;rsquo;s just it, friend! Ah, well, never mind, here you are.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;They might call a halt here or we&amp;rsquo;ll have to do another four miles without eating.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Wasn&amp;rsquo;t it fine when those Germans gave us lifts! You just sit still and are drawn along.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;And here, friend, the people are quite beggarly. There they all seemed to be Poles&amp;mdash;all under the Russian crown&amp;mdash;but here they&amp;rsquo;re all regular Germans.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Singers to the front&amp;rdquo; came the captain&amp;rsquo;s order.</p>
    <p>And from the different ranks some twenty men ran to the front. A drummer, their leader, turned round facing the singers, and flourishing his arm, began a long-drawn-out soldiers&amp;rsquo; song, commencing with the words: <i>&amp;ldquo;Morning dawned, the sun was rising,&amp;rdquo;</i> and concluding: <i>&amp;ldquo;On then, brothers, on to glory, led by Father Kámenski.&amp;rdquo;</i> This song had been composed in the Turkish campaign and now being sung in Austria, the only change being that the words &amp;ldquo;Father Kámenski&amp;rdquo; were replaced by &amp;ldquo;Father Kutúzov.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Having jerked out these last words as soldiers do and waved his arms as if flinging something to the ground, the drummer&amp;mdash;a lean, handsome soldier of forty&amp;mdash;looked sternly at the singers and screwed up his eyes. Then having satisfied himself that all eyes were fixed on him, he raised both arms as if carefully lifting some invisible but precious object above his head and, holding it there for some seconds, suddenly flung it down and began:</p>
    <p><i>&amp;ldquo;Oh, my bower, oh, my bower...!&amp;rdquo;</i></p>
    <p><i>&amp;ldquo;Oh, my bower new...!&amp;rdquo;</i> chimed in twenty voices, and the castanet player, in spite of the burden of his equipment, rushed out to the front and, walking backwards before the company, jerked his shoulders and flourished his castanets as if threatening someone. The soldiers, swinging their arms and keeping time spontaneously, marched with long steps. Behind the company the sound of wheels, the creaking of springs, and the tramp of horses&amp;rsquo; hoofs were heard. Kutúzov and his suite were returning to the town. The commander in chief made a sign that the men should continue to march at ease, and he and all his suite showed pleasure at the sound of the singing and the sight of the dancing soldier and the gay and smartly marching men. In the second file from the right flank, beside which the carriage passed the company, a blue-eyed soldier involuntarily attracted notice. It was Dólokhov marching with particular grace and boldness in time to the song and looking at those driving past as if he pitied all who were not at that moment marching with the company. The hussar cornet of Kutúzov&amp;rsquo;s suite who had mimicked the regimental commander, fell back from the carriage and rode up to Dólokhov.</p>
    <p>Hussar cornet Zherkóv had at one time, in Petersburg, belonged to the wild set led by Dólokhov. Zherkóv had met Dólokhov abroad as a private and had not seen fit to recognize him. But now that Kutúzov had spoken to the gentleman ranker, he addressed him with the cordiality of an old friend.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;My dear fellow, how are you?&amp;rdquo; said he through the singing, making his horse keep pace with the company.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;How am I?&amp;rdquo; Dólokhov answered coldly. &amp;ldquo;I am as you see.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The lively song gave a special flavor to the tone of free and easy gaiety with which Zherkóv spoke, and to the intentional coldness of Dólokhov&amp;rsquo;s reply.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;And how do you get on with the officers?&amp;rdquo; inquired Zherkóv.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;All right. They are good fellows. And how have you wriggled onto the staff?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I was attached; I&amp;rsquo;m on duty.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Both were silent.</p>
    <p><i>&amp;ldquo;She let the hawk fly upward from her wide right sleeve,&amp;rdquo;</i> went the song, arousing an involuntary sensation of courage and cheerfulness. Their conversation would probably have been different but for the effect of that song.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Is it true that Austrians have been beaten?&amp;rdquo; asked Dólokhov.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;The devil only knows! They say so.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m glad,&amp;rdquo; answered Dólokhov briefly and clearly, as the song demanded.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I say, come round some evening and we&amp;rsquo;ll have a game of faro!&amp;rdquo; said Zherkóv.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Why, have you too much money?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Do come.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I can&amp;rsquo;t. I&amp;rsquo;ve sworn not to. I won&amp;rsquo;t drink and won&amp;rsquo;t play till I get reinstated.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well, that&amp;rsquo;s only till the first engagement.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;We shall see.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>They were again silent.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Come if you need anything. One can at least be of use on the staff...&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Dólokhov smiled. &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t trouble. If I want anything, I won&amp;rsquo;t beg&amp;mdash;I&amp;rsquo;ll take it!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well, never mind; I only...&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;And I only...&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Good-by.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Good health...&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <pre class="testable"><i>&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s a long, long way. To my native land...&amp;rdquo;</i></pre>
    <p>Zherkóv touched his horse with the spurs; it pranced excitedly from foot to foot uncertain with which to start, then settled down, galloped past the company, and overtook the carriage, still keeping time to the song.</p>
    <h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
    <p>On returning from the review, Kutúzov took the Austrian general into his private room and, calling his adjutant, asked for some papers relating to the condition of the troops on their arrival, and the letters that had come from the Archduke Ferdinand, who was in command of the advanced army. Prince Andrew Bolkónski came into the room with the required papers. Kutúzov and the Austrian member of the Hofkriegsrath were sitting at the table on which a plan was spread out.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Ah!...&amp;rdquo; said Kutúzov glancing at Bolkónski as if by this exclamation he was asking the adjutant to wait, and he went on with the conversation in French.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;All I can say, General,&amp;rdquo; said he with a pleasant elegance of expression and intonation that obliged one to listen to each deliberately spoken word. It was evident that Kutúzov himself listened with pleasure to his own voice. &amp;ldquo;All I can say, General, is that if the matter depended on my personal wishes, the will of His Majesty the Emperor Francis would have been fulfilled long ago. I should long ago have joined the archduke. And believe me on my honour that to me personally it would be a pleasure to hand over the supreme command of the army into the hands of a better informed and more skillful general&amp;mdash;of whom Austria has so many&amp;mdash;and to lay down all this heavy responsibility. But circumstances are sometimes too strong for us, General.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>And Kutúzov smiled in a way that seemed to say, &amp;ldquo;You are quite at liberty not to believe me and I don&amp;rsquo;t even care whether you do or not, but you have no grounds for telling me so. And that is the whole point.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The Austrian general looked dissatisfied, but had no option but to reply in the same tone.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;On the contrary,&amp;rdquo; he said, in a querulous and angry tone that contrasted with his flattering words, &amp;ldquo;on the contrary, your excellency&amp;rsquo;s participation in the common action is highly valued by His Majesty; but we think the present delay is depriving the splendid Russian troops and their commander of the laurels they have been accustomed to win in their battles,&amp;rdquo; he concluded his evidently prearranged sentence.</p>
    <p>Kutúzov bowed with the same smile.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;But that is my conviction, and judging by the last letter with which His Highness the Archduke Ferdinand has honored me, I imagine that the Austrian troops, under the direction of so skillful a leader as General Mack, have by now already gained a decisive victory and no longer need our aid,&amp;rdquo; said Kutúzov.</p>
    <p>The general frowned. Though there was no definite news of an Austrian defeat, there were many circumstances confirming the unfavorable rumors that were afloat, and so Kutúzov&amp;rsquo;s suggestion of an Austrian victory sounded much like irony. But Kutúzov went on blandly smiling with the same expression, which seemed to say that he had a right to suppose so. And, in fact, the last letter he had received from Mack&amp;rsquo;s army informed him of a victory and stated strategically the position of the army was very favorable.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Give me that letter,&amp;rdquo; said Kutúzov turning to Prince Andrew. &amp;ldquo;Please have a look at it&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;and Kutúzov with an ironical smile about the corners of his mouth read to the Austrian general the following passage, in German, from the Archduke Ferdinand&amp;rsquo;s letter:</p>
    <p>We have fully concentrated forces of nearly seventy thousand men with which to attack and defeat the enemy should he cross the Lech. Also, as we are masters of Ulm, we cannot be deprived of the advantage of commanding both sides of the Danube, so that should the enemy not cross the Lech, we can cross the Danube, throw ourselves on his line of communications, recross the river lower down, and frustrate his intention should he try to direct his whole force against our faithful ally. We shall therefore confidently await the moment when the Imperial Russian army will be fully equipped, and shall then, in conjunction with it, easily find a way to prepare for the enemy the fate he deserves.</p>
    <p>Kutúzov sighed deeply on finishing this paragraph and looked at the member of the Hofkriegsrath mildly and attentively.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;But you know the wise maxim your excellency, advising one to expect the worst,&amp;rdquo; said the Austrian general, evidently wishing to have done with jests and to come to business. He involuntarily looked round at the aide-de-camp.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Excuse me, General,&amp;rdquo; interrupted Kutúzov, also turning to Prince Andrew. &amp;ldquo;Look here, my dear fellow, get from Kozlóvski all the reports from our scouts. Here are two letters from Count Nostitz and here is one from His Highness the Archduke Ferdinand and here are these,&amp;rdquo; he said, handing him several papers, &amp;ldquo;make a neat memorandum in French out of all this, showing all the news we have had of the movements of the Austrian army, and then give it to his excellency.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Prince Andrew bowed his head in token of having understood from the first not only what had been said but also what Kutúzov would have liked to tell him. He gathered up the papers and with a bow to both, stepped softly over the carpet and went out into the waiting room.</p>
    <p>Though not much time had passed since Prince Andrew had left Russia, he had changed greatly during that period. In the expression of his face, in his movements, in his walk, scarcely a trace was left of his former affected languor and indolence. He now looked like a man who has time to think of the impression he makes on others, but is occupied with agreeable and interesting work. His face expressed more satisfaction with himself and those around him, his smile and glance were brighter and more attractive.</p>
    <p>Kutúzov, whom he had overtaken in Poland, had received him very kindly, promised not to forget him, distinguished him above the other adjutants, and had taken him to Vienna and given him the more serious commissions. From Vienna Kutúzov wrote to his old comrade, Prince Andrew&amp;rsquo;s father.</p>
    <p>Your son bids fair to become an officer distinguished by his industry, firmness, and expedition. I consider myself fortunate to have such a subordinate by me.</p>
    <p>On Kutúzov&amp;rsquo;s staff, among his fellow officers and in the army generally, Prince Andrew had, as he had had in Petersburg society, two quite opposite reputations. Some, a minority, acknowledged him to be different from themselves and from everyone else, expected great things of him, listened to him, admired, and imitated him, and with them Prince Andrew was natural and pleasant. Others, the majority, disliked him and considered him conceited, cold, and disagreeable. But among these people Prince Andrew knew how to take his stand so that they respected and even feared him.</p>
    <p>Coming out of Kutúzov&amp;rsquo;s room into the waiting room with the papers in his hand Prince Andrew came up to his comrade, the aide-de-camp on duty, Kozlóvski, who was sitting at the window with a book.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well, Prince?&amp;rdquo; asked Kozlóvski.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I am ordered to write a memorandum explaining why we are not advancing.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;And why is it?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Prince Andrew shrugged his shoulders.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Any news from Mack?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;No.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;If it were true that he has been beaten, news would have come.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Probably,&amp;rdquo; said Prince Andrew moving toward the outer door.</p>
    <p>But at that instant a tall Austrian general in a greatcoat, with the order of Maria Theresa on his neck and a black bandage round his head, who had evidently just arrived, entered quickly, slamming the door. Prince Andrew stopped short.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Commander in Chief Kutúzov?&amp;rdquo; said the newly arrived general speaking quickly with a harsh German accent, looking to both sides and advancing straight toward the inner door.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;The commander in chief is engaged,&amp;rdquo; said Kozlóvski, going hurriedly up to the unknown general and blocking his way to the door. &amp;ldquo;Whom shall I announce?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The unknown general looked disdainfully down at Kozlóvski, who was rather short, as if surprised that anyone should not know him.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;The commander in chief is engaged,&amp;rdquo; repeated Kozlóvski calmly.</p>
    <p>The general&amp;rsquo;s face clouded, his lips quivered and trembled. He took out a notebook, hurriedly scribbled something in pencil, tore out the leaf, gave it to Kozlóvski, stepped quickly to the window, and threw himself into a chair, gazing at those in the room as if asking, &amp;ldquo;Why do they look at me?&amp;rdquo; Then he lifted his head, stretched his neck as if he intended to say something, but immediately, with affected indifference, began to hum to himself, producing a queer sound which immediately broke off. The door of the private room opened and Kutúzov appeared in the doorway. The general with the bandaged head bent forward as though running away from some danger, and, making long, quick strides with his thin legs, went up to Kutúzov.</p>
    <p><i>&amp;ldquo;Vous voyez le malheureux Mack,&amp;rdquo;</i> he uttered in a broken voice.</p>
    <p>Kutúzov&amp;rsquo;s face as he stood in the open doorway remained perfectly immobile for a few moments. Then wrinkles ran over his face like a wave and his forehead became smooth again, he bowed his head respectfully, closed his eyes, silently let Mack enter his room before him, and closed the door himself behind him.</p>
    <p>The report which had been circulated that the Austrians had been beaten and that the whole army had surrendered at Ulm proved to be correct. Within half an hour adjutants had been sent in various directions with orders which showed that the Russian troops, who had hitherto been inactive, would also soon have to meet the enemy.</p>
    <p>Prince Andrew was one of those rare staff officers whose chief interest lay in the general progress of the war. When he saw Mack and heard the details of his disaster he understood that half the campaign was lost, understood all the difficulties of the Russian army&amp;rsquo;s position, and vividly imagined what awaited it and the part he would have to play. Involuntarily he felt a joyful agitation at the thought of the humiliation of arrogant Austria and that in a week&amp;rsquo;s time he might, perhaps, see and take part in the first Russian encounter with the French since Suvórov met them. He feared that Bonaparte&amp;rsquo;s genius might outweigh all the courage of the Russian troops, and at the same time could not admit the idea of his hero being disgraced.</p>
    <p>Excited and irritated by these thoughts Prince Andrew went toward his room to write to his father, to whom he wrote every day. In the corridor he met Nesvítski, with whom he shared a room, and the wag Zherkóv; they were as usual laughing.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Why are you so glum?&amp;rdquo; asked Nesvítski noticing Prince Andrew&amp;rsquo;s pale face and glittering eyes.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s nothing to be gay about,&amp;rdquo; answered Bolkónski.</p>
    <p>Just as Prince Andrew met Nesvítski and Zherkóv, there came toward them from the other end of the corridor, Strauch, an Austrian general who on Kutúzov&amp;rsquo;s staff in charge of the provisioning of the Russian army, and the member of the Hofkriegsrath who had arrived the previous evening. There was room enough in the wide corridor for the generals to pass the three officers quite easily, but Zherkóv, pushing Nesvítski aside with his arm, said in a breathless voice,</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;They&amp;rsquo;re coming!... they&amp;rsquo;re coming!... Stand aside, make way, please make way!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The generals were passing by, looking as if they wished to avoid embarrassing attentions. On the face of the wag Zherkóv there suddenly appeared a stupid smile of glee which he seemed unable to suppress.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Your excellency,&amp;rdquo; said he in German, stepping forward and addressing the Austrian general, &amp;ldquo;I have the honor to congratulate you.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>He bowed his head and scraped first with one foot and then with the other, awkwardly, like a child at a dancing lesson.</p>
    <p>The member of the Hofkriegsrath looked at him severely but, seeing the seriousness of his stupid smile, could not but give him a moment&amp;rsquo;s attention. He screwed up his eyes showing that he was listening.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I have the honor to congratulate you. General Mack has arrived, quite well, only a little bruised just here,&amp;rdquo; he added, pointing with a beaming smile to his head.</p>
    <p>The general frowned, turned away, and went on.</p>
    <p><i>&amp;ldquo;Gott, wie naiv!&amp;rdquo;</i> * said he angrily, after he had gone a few steps.</p>
    <pre class="testable">* &amp;ldquo;Good God, what simplicity!&amp;rdquo;</pre>
    <p>Nesvítski with a laugh threw his arms round Prince Andrew, but Bolkónski, turning still paler, pushed him away with an angry look and turned to Zherkóv. The nervous irritation aroused by the appearance of Mack, the news of his defeat, and the thought of what lay before the Russian army found vent in anger at Zherkóv&amp;rsquo;s untimely jest.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;If you, sir, choose to make a <i>buffoon</i> of yourself,&amp;rdquo; he said sharply, with a slight trembling of the lower jaw, &amp;ldquo;I can&amp;rsquo;t prevent your doing so; but I warn you that if you <i>dare</i> to play the fool in my presence, I will teach you to behave yourself.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Nesvítski and Zherkóv were so surprised by this outburst that they gazed at Bolkónski silently with wide-open eyes.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s the matter? I only congratulated them,&amp;rdquo; said Zherkóv.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I am not jesting with you; please be silent!&amp;rdquo; cried Bolkónski, and taking Nesvítski&amp;rsquo;s arm he left Zherkóv, who did not know what to say.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Come, what&amp;rsquo;s the matter, old fellow?&amp;rdquo; said Nesvítski trying to soothe him.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s the matter?&amp;rdquo; exclaimed Prince Andrew standing still in his excitement. &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t you understand that either we are officers serving our Tsar and our country, rejoicing in the successes and grieving at the misfortunes of our common cause, or we are merely lackeys who care nothing for their master&amp;rsquo;s business. <i>Quarante mille hommes massacrés et l&amp;rsquo;armée de nos alliés détruite, et vous trouvez là le mot pour rire,&amp;rdquo;</i> * he said, as if strengthening his views by this French sentence. <i>&amp;ldquo;C&amp;rsquo;est bien pour un garçon de rien comme cet individu dont vous avez fait un ami, mais pas pour vous, pas pour vous</i>. *(2) Only a <i>hobbledehoy</i> could amuse himself in this way,&amp;rdquo; he added in Russian&amp;mdash;but pronouncing the word with a French accent&amp;mdash;having noticed that Zherkóv could still hear him.</p>
    <pre class="testable">* &amp;ldquo;Forty thousand men massacred and the army of our allies destroyed, and you find that a cause for jesting!&amp;rdquo; * (2) &amp;ldquo;It is all very well for that good-for-nothing fellow of whom you have made a friend, but not for you, not for you.&amp;rdquo;</pre>
    <p>He waited a moment to see whether the cornet would answer, but he turned and went out of the corridor.</p>
    <h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
    <p>The Pávlograd Hussars were stationed two miles from Braunau. The squadron in which Nicholas Rostóv served as a cadet was quartered in the German village of Salzeneck. The best quarters in the village were assigned to cavalry-captain Denísov, the squadron commander, known throughout the whole cavalry division as Váska Denísov. Cadet Rostóv, ever since he had overtaken the regiment in Poland, had lived with the squadron commander.</p>
    <p>On October 11, the day when all was astir at headquarters over the news of Mack&amp;rsquo;s defeat, the camp life of the officers of this squadron was proceeding as usual. Denísov, who had been losing at cards all night, had not yet come home when Rostóv rode back early in the morning from a foraging expedition. Rostóv in his cadet uniform, with a jerk to his horse, rode up to the porch, swung his leg over the saddle with a supple youthful movement, stood for a moment in the stirrup as if loathe to part from his horse, and at last sprang down and called to his orderly.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Ah, Bondarénko, dear friend!&amp;rdquo; said he to the hussar who rushed up headlong to the horse. &amp;ldquo;Walk him up and down, my dear fellow,&amp;rdquo; he continued, with that gay brotherly cordiality which goodhearted young people show to everyone when they are happy.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Yes, your excellency,&amp;rdquo; answered the Ukrainian gaily, tossing his head.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Mind, walk him up and down well!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Another hussar also rushed toward the horse, but Bondarénko had already thrown the reins of the snaffle bridle over the horse&amp;rsquo;s head. It was evident that the cadet was liberal with his tips and that it paid to serve him. Rostóv patted the horse&amp;rsquo;s neck and then his flank, and lingered for a moment.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Splendid! What a horse he will be!&amp;rdquo; he thought with a smile, and holding up his saber, his spurs jingling, he ran up the steps of the porch. His landlord, who in a waistcoat and a pointed cap, pitchfork in hand, was clearing manure from the cowhouse, looked out, and his face immediately brightened on seeing Rostóv. <i>&amp;ldquo;Schön gut Morgen! Schön gut Morgen!&amp;rdquo;</i> * he said winking with a merry smile, evidently pleased to greet the young man.</p>
    <pre class="testable">* &amp;ldquo;A very good morning! A very good morning!&amp;rdquo;</pre>
    <p><i>&amp;ldquo;Schon fleissig?&amp;rdquo;</i> * said Rostóv with the same gay brotherly smile which did not leave his eager face. <i>&amp;ldquo;Hoch Oestreicher! Hoch Russen! Kaiser Alexander hoch!&amp;rdquo;</i> *(2) said he, quoting words often repeated by the German landlord.</p>
    <pre class="testable">* &amp;ldquo;Busy already?&amp;rdquo; * (2) &amp;ldquo;Hurrah for the Austrians! Hurrah for the Russians! Hurrah for Emperor Alexander!&amp;rdquo;</pre>
    <p>The German laughed, came out of the cowshed, pulled off his cap, and waving it above his head cried:</p>
    <p><i>&amp;ldquo;Und die ganze Welt hoch!&amp;rdquo;</i> *</p>
    <pre class="testable">* &amp;ldquo;And hurrah for the whole world!&amp;rdquo;</pre>
    <p>Rostóv waved his cap above his head like the German and cried laughing, <i>&amp;ldquo;Und vivat die ganze Welt!&amp;rdquo;</i> Though neither the German cleaning his cowshed nor Rostóv back with his platoon from foraging for hay had any reason for rejoicing, they looked at each other with joyful delight and brotherly love, wagged their heads in token of their mutual affection, and parted smiling, the German returning to his cowshed and Rostóv going to the cottage he occupied with Denísov.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;What about your master?&amp;rdquo; he asked Lavrúshka, Denísov&amp;rsquo;s orderly, whom all the regiment knew for a rogue.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Hasn&amp;rsquo;t been in since the evening. Must have been losing,&amp;rdquo; answered Lavrúshka. &amp;ldquo;I know by now, if he wins he comes back early to brag about it, but if he stays out till morning it means he&amp;rsquo;s lost and will come back in a rage. Will you have coffee?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Yes, bring some.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Ten minutes later Lavrúshka brought the coffee. &amp;ldquo;He&amp;rsquo;s coming!&amp;rdquo; said he. &amp;ldquo;Now for trouble!&amp;rdquo; Rostóv looked out of the window and saw Denísov coming home. Denísov was a small man with a red face, sparkling black eyes, and black tousled mustache and hair. He wore an unfastened cloak, wide breeches hanging down in creases, and a crumpled shako on the back of his head. He came up to the porch gloomily, hanging his head.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Lavwúska!&amp;rdquo; he shouted loudly and angrily, &amp;ldquo;take it off, blockhead!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well, I am taking it off,&amp;rdquo; replied Lavrúshka&amp;rsquo;s voice.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Ah, you&amp;rsquo;re up already,&amp;rdquo; said Denísov, entering the room.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Long ago,&amp;rdquo; answered Rostóv, &amp;ldquo;I have already been for the hay, and have seen Fräulein Mathilde.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Weally! And I&amp;rsquo;ve been losing, bwother. I lost yesterday like a damned fool!&amp;rdquo; cried Denísov, not pronouncing his <i>r</i>&amp;rsquo;s. &amp;ldquo;Such ill luck! Such ill luck. As soon as you left, it began and went on. Hullo there! Tea!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Puckering up his face though smiling, and showing his short strong teeth, he began with stubby fingers of both hands to ruffle up his thick tangled black hair.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;And what devil made me go to that wat?&amp;rdquo; (an officer nicknamed &amp;ldquo;the rat&amp;rdquo;) he said, rubbing his forehead and whole face with both hands. &amp;ldquo;Just fancy, he didn&amp;rsquo;t let me win a single cahd, not one cahd.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>He took the lighted pipe that was offered to him, gripped it in his fist, and tapped it on the floor, making the sparks fly, while he continued to shout.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;He lets one win the singles and collahs it as soon as one doubles it; gives the singles and snatches the doubles!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>He scattered the burning tobacco, smashed the pipe, and threw it away. Then he remained silent for a while, and all at once looked cheerfully with his glittering, black eyes at Rostóv.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;If at least we had some women here; but there&amp;rsquo;s nothing foh one to do but dwink. If we could only get to fighting soon. Hullo, who&amp;rsquo;s there?&amp;rdquo; he said, turning to the door as he heard a tread of heavy boots and the clinking of spurs that came to a stop, and a respectful cough.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;The squadron quartermaster!&amp;rdquo; said Lavrúshka.</p>
    <p>Denísov&amp;rsquo;s face puckered still more.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Wetched!&amp;rdquo; he muttered, throwing down a purse with some gold in it. &amp;ldquo;Wostóv, deah fellow, just see how much there is left and shove the purse undah the pillow,&amp;rdquo; he said, and went out to the quartermaster.</p>
    <p>Rostóv took the money and, mechanically arranging the old and new coins in separate piles, began counting them.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Ah! Telyánin! How d&amp;rsquo;ye do? They plucked me last night,&amp;rdquo; came Denísov&amp;rsquo;s voice from the next room.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Where? At Bykov&amp;rsquo;s, at the rat&amp;rsquo;s... I knew it,&amp;rdquo; replied a piping voice, and Lieutenant Telyánin, a small officer of the same squadron, entered the room.</p>
    <p>Rostóv thrust the purse under the pillow and shook the damp little hand which was offered him. Telyánin for some reason had been transferred from the Guards just before this campaign. He behaved very well in the regiment but was not liked; Rostóv especially detested him and was unable to overcome or conceal his groundless antipathy to the man.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well, young cavalryman, how is my Rook behaving?&amp;rdquo; he asked. (Rook was a young horse Telyánin had sold to Rostóv.)</p>
    <p>The lieutenant never looked the man he was speaking to straight in the face; his eyes continually wandered from one object to another.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I saw you riding this morning...&amp;rdquo; he added.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Oh, he&amp;rsquo;s all right, a good horse,&amp;rdquo; answered Rostóv, though the horse for which he had paid seven hundred rubbles was not worth half that sum. &amp;ldquo;He&amp;rsquo;s begun to go a little lame on the left foreleg,&amp;rdquo; he added.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;The hoof&amp;rsquo;s cracked! That&amp;rsquo;s nothing. I&amp;rsquo;ll teach you what to do and show you what kind of rivet to use.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Yes, please do,&amp;rdquo; said Rostóv.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll show you, I&amp;rsquo;ll show you! It&amp;rsquo;s not a secret. And it&amp;rsquo;s a horse you&amp;rsquo;ll thank me for.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Then I&amp;rsquo;ll have it brought round,&amp;rdquo; said Rostóv wishing to avoid Telyánin, and he went out to give the order.</p>
    <p>In the passage Denísov, with a pipe, was squatting on the threshold facing the quartermaster who was reporting to him. On seeing Rostóv, Denísov screwed up his face and pointing over his shoulder with his thumb to the room where Telyánin was sitting, he frowned and gave a shudder of disgust.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Ugh! I don&amp;rsquo;t like that fellow,&amp;rdquo; he said, regardless of the quartermaster&amp;rsquo;s presence.</p>
    <p>Rostóv shrugged his shoulders as much as to say: &amp;ldquo;Nor do I, but what&amp;rsquo;s one to do?&amp;rdquo; and, having given his order, he returned to Telyánin.</p>
    <p>Telyánin was sitting in the same indolent pose in which Rostóv had left him, rubbing his small white hands.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well there certainly are disgusting people,&amp;rdquo; thought Rostóv as he entered.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Have you told them to bring the horse?&amp;rdquo; asked Telyánin, getting up and looking carelessly about him.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I have.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Let us go ourselves. I only came round to ask Denísov about yesterday&amp;rsquo;s order. Have you got it, Denísov?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Not yet. But where are you off to?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I want to teach this young man how to shoe a horse,&amp;rdquo; said Telyánin.</p>
    <p>They went through the porch and into the stable. The lieutenant explained how to rivet the hoof and went away to his own quarters.</p>
    <p>When Rostóv went back there was a bottle of vodka and a sausage on the table. Denísov was sitting there scratching with his pen on a sheet of paper. He looked gloomily in Rostóv&amp;rsquo;s face and said: &amp;ldquo;I am witing to her.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>He leaned his elbows on the table with his pen in his hand and, evidently glad of a chance to say quicker in words what he wanted to write, told Rostóv the contents of his letter.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;You see, my fwiend,&amp;rdquo; he said, &amp;ldquo;we sleep when we don&amp;rsquo;t love. We are childwen of the dust... but one falls in love and one is a God, one is pua&amp;rsquo; as on the fihst day of cweation... Who&amp;rsquo;s that now? Send him to the devil, I&amp;rsquo;m busy!&amp;rdquo; he shouted to Lavrúshka, who went up to him not in the least abashed.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Who should it be? You yourself told him to come. It&amp;rsquo;s the quartermaster for the money.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Denísov frowned and was about to shout some reply but stopped.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Wetched business,&amp;rdquo; he muttered to himself. &amp;ldquo;How much is left in the puhse?&amp;rdquo; he asked, turning to Rostóv.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Seven new and three old imperials.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Oh, it&amp;rsquo;s wetched! Well, what are you standing there for, you sca&amp;rsquo;cwow? Call the quahtehmasteh,&amp;rdquo; he shouted to Lavrúshka.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Please, Denísov, let me lend you some: I have some, you know,&amp;rdquo; said Rostóv, blushing.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t like bowwowing from my own fellows, I don&amp;rsquo;t,&amp;rdquo; growled Denísov.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;But if you won&amp;rsquo;t accept money from me like a comrade, you will offend me. Really I have some,&amp;rdquo; Rostóv repeated.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;No, I tell you.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>And Denísov went to the bed to get the purse from under the pillow.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Where have you put it, Wostóv?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Under the lower pillow.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s not there.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Denísov threw both pillows on the floor. The purse was not there.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s a miwacle.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Wait, haven&amp;rsquo;t you dropped it?&amp;rdquo; said Rostóv, picking up the pillows one at a time and shaking them.</p>
    <p>He pulled off the quilt and shook it. The purse was not there.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Dear me, can I have forgotten? No, I remember thinking that you kept it under your head like a treasure,&amp;rdquo; said Rostóv. &amp;ldquo;I put it just here. Where is it?&amp;rdquo; he asked, turning to Lavrúshka.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I haven&amp;rsquo;t been in the room. It must be where you put it.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;But it isn&amp;rsquo;t?...&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re always like that; you thwow a thing down anywhere and forget it. Feel in your pockets.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;No, if I hadn&amp;rsquo;t thought of it being a treasure,&amp;rdquo; said Rostóv, &amp;ldquo;but I remember putting it there.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Lavrúshka turned all the bedding over, looked under the bed and under the table, searched everywhere, and stood still in the middle of the room. Denísov silently watched Lavrúshka&amp;rsquo;s movements, and when the latter threw up his arms in surprise saying it was nowhere to be found Denísov glanced at Rostóv.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Wostóv, you&amp;rsquo;ve not been playing schoolboy twicks...&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Rostóv felt Denísov&amp;rsquo;s gaze fixed on him, raised his eyes, and instantly dropped them again. All the blood which had seemed congested somewhere below his throat rushed to his face and eyes. He could not draw breath.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;And there hasn&amp;rsquo;t been anyone in the room except the lieutenant and yourselves. It must be here somewhere,&amp;rdquo; said Lavrúshka.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Now then, you devil&amp;rsquo;s puppet, look alive and hunt for it!&amp;rdquo; shouted Denísov, suddenly, turning purple and rushing at the man with a threatening gesture. &amp;ldquo;If the purse isn&amp;rsquo;t found I&amp;rsquo;ll flog you, I&amp;rsquo;ll flog you all.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Rostóv, his eyes avoiding Denísov, began buttoning his coat, buckled on his saber, and put on his cap.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I must have that purse, I tell you,&amp;rdquo; shouted Denísov, shaking his orderly by the shoulders and knocking him against the wall.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Denísov, let him alone, I know who has taken it,&amp;rdquo; said Rostóv, going toward the door without raising his eyes. Denísov paused, thought a moment, and, evidently understanding what Rostóv hinted at, seized his arm.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Nonsense!&amp;rdquo; he cried, and the veins on his forehead and neck stood out like cords. &amp;ldquo;You are mad, I tell you. I won&amp;rsquo;t allow it. The purse is here! I&amp;rsquo;ll flay this scoundwel alive, and it will be found.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I know who has taken it,&amp;rdquo; repeated Rostóv in an unsteady voice, and went to the door.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;And I tell you, don&amp;rsquo;t you dahe to do it!&amp;rdquo; shouted Denísov, rushing at the cadet to restrain him.</p>
    <p>But Rostóv pulled away his arm and, with as much anger as though Denísov were his worst enemy, firmly fixed his eyes directly on his face.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Do you understand what you&amp;rsquo;re saying?&amp;rdquo; he said in a trembling voice. &amp;ldquo;There was no one else in the room except myself. So that if it is not so, then...&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>He could not finish, and ran out of the room.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Ah, may the devil take you and evewybody,&amp;rdquo; were the last words Rostóv heard.</p>
    <p>Rostóv went to Telyánin&amp;rsquo;s quarters.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;The master is not in, he&amp;rsquo;s gone to headquarters,&amp;rdquo; said Telyánin&amp;rsquo;s orderly. &amp;ldquo;Has something happened?&amp;rdquo; he added, surprised at the cadet&amp;rsquo;s troubled face.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;No, nothing.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;ve only just missed him,&amp;rdquo; said the orderly.</p>
    <p>The headquarters were situated two miles away from Salzeneck, and Rostóv, without returning home, took a horse and rode there. There was an inn in the village which the officers frequented. Rostóv rode up to it and saw Telyánin&amp;rsquo;s horse at the porch.</p>
    <p>In the second room of the inn the lieutenant was sitting over a dish of sausages and a bottle of wine.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Ah, you&amp;rsquo;ve come here too, young man!&amp;rdquo; he said, smiling and raising his eyebrows.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Yes,&amp;rdquo; said Rostóv as if it cost him a great deal to utter the word; and he sat down at the nearest table.</p>
    <p>Both were silent. There were two Germans and a Russian officer in the room. No one spoke and the only sounds heard were the clatter of knives and the munching of the lieutenant.</p>
    <p>When Telyánin had finished his lunch he took out of his pocket a double purse and, drawing its rings aside with his small, white, turned-up fingers, drew out a gold imperial, and lifting his eyebrows gave it to the waiter.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Please be quick,&amp;rdquo; he said.</p>
    <p>The coin was a new one. Rostóv rose and went up to Telyánin.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Allow me to look at your purse,&amp;rdquo; he said in a low, almost inaudible, voice.</p>
    <p>With shifting eyes but eyebrows still raised, Telyánin handed him the purse.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s a nice purse. Yes, yes,&amp;rdquo; he said, growing suddenly pale, and added, &amp;ldquo;Look at it, young man.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Rostóv took the purse in his hand, examined it and the money in it, and looked at Telyánin. The lieutenant was looking about in his usual way and suddenly seemed to grow very merry.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;If we get to Vienna I&amp;rsquo;ll get rid of it there but in these wretched little towns there&amp;rsquo;s nowhere to spend it,&amp;rdquo; said he. &amp;ldquo;Well, let me have it, young man, I&amp;rsquo;m going.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Rostóv did not speak.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;And you? Are you going to have lunch too? They feed you quite decently here,&amp;rdquo; continued Telyánin. &amp;ldquo;Now then, let me have it.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>He stretched out his hand to take hold of the purse. Rostóv let go of it. Telyánin took the purse and began carelessly slipping it into the pocket of his riding breeches, with his eyebrows lifted and his mouth slightly open, as if to say, &amp;ldquo;Yes, yes, I am putting my purse in my pocket and that&amp;rsquo;s quite simple and is no one else&amp;rsquo;s business.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well, young man?&amp;rdquo; he said with a sigh, and from under his lifted brows he glanced into Rostóv&amp;rsquo;s eyes.</p>
    <p>Some flash as of an electric spark shot from Telyánin&amp;rsquo;s eyes to Rostóv&amp;rsquo;s and back, and back again and again in an instant.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Come here,&amp;rdquo; said Rostóv, catching hold of Telyánin&amp;rsquo;s arm and almost dragging him to the window. &amp;ldquo;That money is Denísov&amp;rsquo;s; you took it...&amp;rdquo; he whispered just above Telyánin&amp;rsquo;s ear.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;What? What? How dare you? What?&amp;rdquo; said Telyánin.</p>
    <p>But these words came like a piteous, despairing cry and an entreaty for pardon. As soon as Rostóv heard them, an enormous load of doubt fell from him. He was glad, and at the same instant began to pity the miserable man who stood before him, but the task he had begun had to be completed.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Heaven only knows what the people here may imagine,&amp;rdquo; muttered Telyánin, taking up his cap and moving toward a small empty room. &amp;ldquo;We must have an explanation...&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I know it and shall prove it,&amp;rdquo; said Rostóv.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I...&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Every muscle of Telyánin&amp;rsquo;s pale, terrified face began to quiver, his eyes still shifted from side to side but with a downward look not rising to Rostóv&amp;rsquo;s face, and his sobs were audible.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Count!... Don&amp;rsquo;t ruin a young fellow... here is this wretched money, take it...&amp;rdquo; He threw it on the table. &amp;ldquo;I have an old father and mother!...&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Rostóv took the money, avoiding Telyánin&amp;rsquo;s eyes, and went out of the room without a word. But at the door he stopped and then retraced his steps. &amp;ldquo;O God,&amp;rdquo; he said with tears in his eyes, &amp;ldquo;how could you do it?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Count...&amp;rdquo; said Telyánin drawing nearer to him.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t touch me,&amp;rdquo; said Rostóv, drawing back. &amp;ldquo;If you need it, take the money,&amp;rdquo; and he threw the purse to him and ran out of the inn.</p>
    <h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
    <p>That same evening there was an animated discussion among the squadron&amp;rsquo;s officers in Denísov&amp;rsquo;s quarters.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;And I tell you, Rostóv, that you must apologize to the colonel!&amp;rdquo; said a tall, grizzly-haired staff captain, with enormous mustaches and many wrinkles on his large features, to Rostóv who was crimson with excitement.</p>
    <p>The staff captain, Kírsten, had twice been reduced to the ranks for affairs of honor and had twice regained his commission.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I will allow no one to call me a liar!&amp;rdquo; cried Rostóv. &amp;ldquo;He told me I lied, and I told him he lied. And there it rests. He may keep me on duty every day, or may place me under arrest, but no one can make me apologize, because if he, as commander of this regiment, thinks it beneath his dignity to give me satisfaction, then...&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;You just wait a moment, my dear fellow, and listen,&amp;rdquo; interrupted the staff captain in his deep bass, calmly stroking his long mustache. &amp;ldquo;You tell the colonel in the presence of other officers that an officer has stolen...&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not to blame that the conversation began in the presence of other officers. Perhaps I ought not to have spoken before them, but I am not a diplomatist. That&amp;rsquo;s why I joined the hussars, thinking that here one would not need finesse; and he tells me that I am lying&amp;mdash;so let him give me satisfaction...&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s all right. No one thinks you a coward, but that&amp;rsquo;s not the point. Ask Denísov whether it is not out of the question for a cadet to demand satisfaction of his regimental commander?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Denísov sat gloomily biting his mustache and listening to the conversation, evidently with no wish to take part in it. He answered the staff captain&amp;rsquo;s question by a disapproving shake of his head.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;You speak to the colonel about this nasty business before other officers,&amp;rdquo; continued the staff captain, &amp;ldquo;and Bogdánich&amp;rdquo; (the colonel was called Bogdánich) &amp;ldquo;shuts you up.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;He did not shut me up, he said I was telling an untruth.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well, have it so, and you talked a lot of nonsense to him and must apologize.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Not on any account!&amp;rdquo; exclaimed Rostóv.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I did not expect this of you,&amp;rdquo; said the staff captain seriously and severely. &amp;ldquo;You don&amp;rsquo;t wish to apologize, but, man, it&amp;rsquo;s not only to him but to the whole regiment&amp;mdash;all of us&amp;mdash;you&amp;rsquo;re to blame all round. The case is this: you ought to have thought the matter over and taken advice; but no, you go and blurt it all straight out before the officers. Now what was the colonel to do? Have the officer tried and disgrace the whole regiment? Disgrace the whole regiment because of one scoundrel? Is that how you look at it? We don&amp;rsquo;t see it like that. And Bogdánich was a brick: he told you you were saying what was not true. It&amp;rsquo;s not pleasant, but what&amp;rsquo;s to be done, my dear fellow? You landed yourself in it. And now, when one wants to smooth the thing over, some conceit prevents your apologizing, and you wish to make the whole affair public. You are offended at being put on duty a bit, but why not apologize to an old and honorable officer? Whatever Bogdánich may be, anyway he is an honorable and brave old colonel! You&amp;rsquo;re quick at taking offense, but you don&amp;rsquo;t mind disgracing the whole regiment!&amp;rdquo; The staff captain&amp;rsquo;s voice began to tremble. &amp;ldquo;You have been in the regiment next to no time, my lad, you&amp;rsquo;re here today and tomorrow you&amp;rsquo;ll be appointed adjutant somewhere and can snap your fingers when it is said &amp;lsquo;There are thieves among the Pávlograd officers!&amp;rsquo; But it&amp;rsquo;s not all the same to us! Am I not right, Denísov? It&amp;rsquo;s not the same!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Denísov remained silent and did not move, but occasionally looked with his glittering black eyes at Rostóv.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;You value your own pride and don&amp;rsquo;t wish to apologize,&amp;rdquo; continued the staff captain, &amp;ldquo;but we old fellows, who have grown up in and, God willing, are going to die in the regiment, we prize the honor of the regiment, and Bogdánich knows it. Oh, we do prize it, old fellow! And all this is not right, it&amp;rsquo;s not right! You may take offense or not but I always stick to mother truth. It&amp;rsquo;s not right!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>And the staff captain rose and turned away from Rostóv.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s twue, devil take it!&amp;rdquo; shouted Denísov, jumping up. &amp;ldquo;Now then, Wostóv, now then!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Rostóv, growing red and pale alternately, looked first at one officer and then at the other.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;No, gentlemen, no... you mustn&amp;rsquo;t think... I quite understand. You&amp;rsquo;re wrong to think that of me... I... for me... for the honor of the regiment I&amp;rsquo;d... Ah well, I&amp;rsquo;ll show that in action, and for me the honor of the flag... Well, never mind, it&amp;rsquo;s true I&amp;rsquo;m to blame, to blame all round. Well, what else do you want?...&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Come, that&amp;rsquo;s right, Count!&amp;rdquo; cried the staff captain, turning round and clapping Rostóv on the shoulder with his big hand.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I tell you,&amp;rdquo; shouted Denísov, &amp;ldquo;he&amp;rsquo;s a fine fellow.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s better, Count,&amp;rdquo; said the staff captain, beginning to address Rostóv by his title, as if in recognition of his confession. &amp;ldquo;Go and apologize, your excellency. Yes, go!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Gentlemen, I&amp;rsquo;ll do anything. No one shall hear a word from me,&amp;rdquo; said Rostóv in an imploring voice, &amp;ldquo;but I can&amp;rsquo;t apologize, by God I can&amp;rsquo;t, do what you will! How can I go and apologize like a little boy asking forgiveness?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Denísov began to laugh.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;ll be worse for you. Bogdánich is vindictive and you&amp;rsquo;ll pay for your obstinacy,&amp;rdquo; said Kírsten.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;No, on my word it&amp;rsquo;s not obstinacy! I can&amp;rsquo;t describe the feeling. I can&amp;rsquo;t...&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well, it&amp;rsquo;s as you like,&amp;rdquo; said the staff captain. &amp;ldquo;And what has become of that scoundrel?&amp;rdquo; he asked Denísov.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;He has weported himself sick, he&amp;rsquo;s to be stwuck off the list tomowwow,&amp;rdquo; muttered Denísov.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;It is an illness, there&amp;rsquo;s no other way of explaining it,&amp;rdquo; said the staff captain.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Illness or not, he&amp;rsquo;d better not cwoss my path. I&amp;rsquo;d kill him!&amp;rdquo; shouted Denísov in a bloodthirsty tone.</p>
    <p>Just then Zherkóv entered the room.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;What brings you here?&amp;rdquo; cried the officers turning to the newcomer.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re to go into action, gentlemen! Mack has surrendered with his whole army.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s not true!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve seen him myself!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;What? Saw the real Mack? With hands and feet?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Into action! Into action! Bring him a bottle for such news! But how did you come here?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve been sent back to the regiment all on account of that devil, Mack. An Austrian general complained of me. I congratulated him on Mack&amp;rsquo;s arrival... What&amp;rsquo;s the matter, Rostóv? You look as if you&amp;rsquo;d just come out of a hot bath.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Oh, my dear fellow, we&amp;rsquo;re in such a stew here these last two days.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The regimental adjutant came in and confirmed the news brought by Zherkóv. They were under orders to advance next day.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re going into action, gentlemen!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well, thank God! We&amp;rsquo;ve been sitting here too long!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
    <p>Kutúzov fell back toward Vienna, destroying behind him the bridges over the rivers Inn (at Braunau) and Traun (near Linz). On October 23 the Russian troops were crossing the river Enns. At midday the Russian baggage train, the artillery, and columns of troops were defiling through the town of Enns on both sides of the bridge.</p>
    <p>It was a warm, rainy, autumnal day. The wide expanse that opened out before the heights on which the Russian batteries stood guarding the bridge was at times veiled by a diaphanous curtain of slanting rain, and then, suddenly spread out in the sunlight, far-distant objects could be clearly seen glittering as though freshly varnished. Down below, the little town could be seen with its white, red-roofed houses, its cathedral, and its bridge, on both sides of which streamed jostling masses of Russian troops. At the bend of the Danube, vessels, an island, and a castle with a park surrounded by the waters of the confluence of the Enns and the Danube became visible, and the rocky left bank of the Danube covered with pine forests, with a mystic background of green treetops and bluish gorges. The turrets of a convent stood out beyond a wild virgin pine forest, and far away on the other side of the Enns the enemy&amp;rsquo;s horse patrols could be discerned.</p>
    <p>Among the field guns on the brow of the hill the general in command of the rearguard stood with a staff officer, scanning the country through his fieldglass. A little behind them Nesvítski, who had been sent to the rearguard by the commander in chief, was sitting on the trail of a gun carriage. A Cossack who accompanied him had handed him a knapsack and a flask, and Nesvítski was treating some officers to pies and real <i>doppelkümmel</i>. The officers gladly gathered round him, some on their knees, some squatting Turkish fashion on the wet grass.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Yes, the Austrian prince who built that castle was no fool. It&amp;rsquo;s a fine place! Why are you not eating anything, gentlemen?&amp;rdquo; Nesvítski was saying.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Thank you very much, Prince,&amp;rdquo; answered one of the officers, pleased to be talking to a staff officer of such importance. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s a lovely place! We passed close to the park and saw two deer... and what a splendid house!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Look, Prince,&amp;rdquo; said another, who would have dearly liked to take another pie but felt shy, and therefore pretended to be examining the countryside&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;See, our infantrymen have already got there. Look there in the meadow behind the village, three of them are dragging something. They&amp;rsquo;ll ransack that castle,&amp;rdquo; he remarked with evident approval.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;So they will,&amp;rdquo; said Nesvítski. &amp;ldquo;No, but what I should like,&amp;rdquo; added he, munching a pie in his moist-lipped handsome mouth, &amp;ldquo;would be to slip in over there.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>He pointed with a smile to a turreted nunnery, and his eyes narrowed and gleamed.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;That would be fine, gentlemen!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The officers laughed.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Just to flutter the nuns a bit. They say there are Italian girls among them. On my word I&amp;rsquo;d give five years of my life for it!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;They must be feeling dull, too,&amp;rdquo; said one of the bolder officers, laughing.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile the staff officer standing in front pointed out something to the general, who looked through his field glass.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Yes, so it is, so it is,&amp;rdquo; said the general angrily, lowering the field glass and shrugging his shoulders, &amp;ldquo;so it is! They&amp;rsquo;ll be fired on at the crossing. And why are they dawdling there?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>On the opposite side the enemy could be seen by the naked eye, and from their battery a milk-white cloud arose. Then came the distant report of a shot, and our troops could be seen hurrying to the crossing.</p>
    <p>Nesvítski rose, puffing, and went up to the general, smiling.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Would not your excellency like a little refreshment?&amp;rdquo; he said.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s a bad business,&amp;rdquo; said the general without answering him, &amp;ldquo;our men have been wasting time.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Hadn&amp;rsquo;t I better ride over, your excellency?&amp;rdquo; asked Nesvítski.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Yes, please do,&amp;rdquo; answered the general, and he repeated the order that had already once been given in detail: &amp;ldquo;and tell the hussars that they are to cross last and to fire the bridge as I ordered; and the inflammable material on the bridge must be reinspected.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Very good,&amp;rdquo; answered Nesvítski.</p>
    <p>He called the Cossack with his horse, told him to put away the knapsack and flask, and swung his heavy person easily into the saddle.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll really call in on the nuns,&amp;rdquo; he said to the officers who watched him smilingly, and he rode off by the winding path down the hill.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Now then, let&amp;rsquo;s see how far it will carry, Captain. Just try!&amp;rdquo; said the general, turning to an artillery officer. &amp;ldquo;Have a little fun to pass the time.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Crew, to your guns!&amp;rdquo; commanded the officer.</p>
    <p>In a moment the men came running gaily from their campfires and began loading.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;One!&amp;rdquo; came the command.</p>
    <p>Number one jumped briskly aside. The gun rang out with a deafening metallic roar, and a whistling grenade flew above the heads of our troops below the hill and fell far short of the enemy, a little smoke showing the spot where it burst.</p>
    <p>The faces of officers and men brightened up at the sound. Everyone got up and began watching the movements of our troops below, as plainly visible as if but a stone&amp;rsquo;s throw away, and the movements of the approaching enemy farther off. At the same instant the sun came fully out from behind the clouds, and the clear sound of the solitary shot and the brilliance of the bright sunshine merged in a single joyous and spirited impression.</p>
    <h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
    <p>Two of the enemy&amp;rsquo;s shots had already flown across the bridge, where there was a crush. Halfway across stood Prince Nesvítski, who had alighted from his horse and whose big body was jammed against the railings. He looked back laughing to the Cossack who stood a few steps behind him holding two horses by their bridles. Each time Prince Nesvítski tried to move on, soldiers and carts pushed him back again and pressed him against the railings, and all he could do was to smile.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;What a fine fellow you are, friend!&amp;rdquo; said the Cossack to a convoy soldier with a wagon, who was pressing onto the infantrymen who were crowded together close to his wheels and his horses. &amp;ldquo;What a fellow! You can&amp;rsquo;t wait a moment! Don&amp;rsquo;t you see the general wants to pass?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>But the convoyman took no notice of the word &amp;ldquo;general&amp;rdquo; and shouted at the soldiers who were blocking his way. &amp;ldquo;Hi there, boys! Keep to the left! Wait a bit.&amp;rdquo; But the soldiers, crowded together shoulder to shoulder, their bayonets interlocking, moved over the bridge in a dense mass. Looking down over the rails Prince Nesvítski saw the rapid, noisy little waves of the Enns, which rippling and eddying round the piles of the bridge chased each other along. Looking on the bridge he saw equally uniform living waves of soldiers, shoulder straps, covered shakos, knapsacks, bayonets, long muskets, and, under the shakos, faces with broad cheekbones, sunken cheeks, and listless tired expressions, and feet that moved through the sticky mud that covered the planks of the bridge. Sometimes through the monotonous waves of men, like a fleck of white foam on the waves of the Enns, an officer, in a cloak and with a type of face different from that of the men, squeezed his way along; sometimes like a chip of wood whirling in the river, an hussar on foot, an orderly, or a townsman was carried through the waves of infantry; and sometimes like a log floating down the river, an officers&amp;rsquo; or company&amp;rsquo;s baggage wagon, piled high, leather covered, and hemmed in on all sides, moved across the bridge.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s as if a dam had burst,&amp;rdquo; said the Cossack hopelessly. &amp;ldquo;Are there many more of you to come?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;A million all but one!&amp;rdquo; replied a waggish soldier in a torn coat, with a wink, and passed on followed by another, an old man.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;If <i>he</i>&amp;rdquo; (<i>he</i> meant the enemy) &amp;ldquo;begins popping at the bridge now,&amp;rdquo; said the old soldier dismally to a comrade, &amp;ldquo;you&amp;rsquo;ll forget to scratch yourself.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>That soldier passed on, and after him came another sitting on a cart.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Where the devil have the leg bands been shoved to?&amp;rdquo; said an orderly, running behind the cart and fumbling in the back of it.</p>
    <p>And he also passed on with the wagon. Then came some merry soldiers who had evidently been drinking.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;And then, old fellow, he gives him one in the teeth with the butt end of his gun...&amp;rdquo; a soldier whose greatcoat was well tucked up said gaily, with a wide swing of his arm.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Yes, the ham was just delicious...&amp;rdquo; answered another with a loud laugh. And they, too, passed on, so that Nesvítski did not learn who had been struck on the teeth, or what the ham had to do with it.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Bah! How they scurry. He just sends a ball and they think they&amp;rsquo;ll all be killed,&amp;rdquo; a sergeant was saying angrily and reproachfully.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;As it flies past me, Daddy, the ball I mean,&amp;rdquo; said a young soldier with an enormous mouth, hardly refraining from laughing, &amp;ldquo;I felt like dying of fright. I did, &amp;lsquo;pon my word, I got that frightened!&amp;rdquo; said he, as if bragging of having been frightened.</p>
    <p>That one also passed. Then followed a cart unlike any that had gone before. It was a German cart with a pair of horses led by a German, and seemed loaded with a whole houseful of effects. A fine brindled cow with a large udder was attached to the cart behind. A woman with an unweaned baby, an old woman, and a healthy German girl with bright red cheeks were sitting on some feather beds. Evidently these fugitives were allowed to pass by special permission. The eyes of all the soldiers turned toward the women, and while the vehicle was passing at foot pace all the soldiers&amp;rsquo; remarks related to the two young ones. Every face bore almost the same smile, expressing unseemly thoughts about the women.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Just see, the German sausage is making tracks, too!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Sell me the missis,&amp;rdquo; said another soldier, addressing the German, who, angry and frightened, strode energetically along with downcast eyes.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;See how smart she&amp;rsquo;s made herself! Oh, the devils!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;There, Fedótov, you should be quartered on them!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I have seen as much before now, mate!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Where are you going?&amp;rdquo; asked an infantry officer who was eating an apple, also half smiling as he looked at the handsome girl.</p>
    <p>The German closed his eyes, signifying that he did not understand.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Take it if you like,&amp;rdquo; said the officer, giving the girl an apple.</p>
    <p>The girl smiled and took it. Nesvítski like the rest of the men on the bridge did not take his eyes off the women till they had passed. When they had gone by, the same stream of soldiers followed, with the same kind of talk, and at last all stopped. As often happens, the horses of a convoy wagon became restive at the end of the bridge, and the whole crowd had to wait.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;And why are they stopping? There&amp;rsquo;s no proper order!&amp;rdquo; said the soldiers. &amp;ldquo;Where are you shoving to? Devil take you! Can&amp;rsquo;t you wait? It&amp;rsquo;ll be worse if he fires the bridge. See, here&amp;rsquo;s an officer jammed in too&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;different voices were saying in the crowd, as the men looked at one another, and all pressed toward the exit from the bridge.</p>
    <p>Looking down at the waters of the Enns under the bridge, Nesvítski suddenly heard a sound new to him, of something swiftly approaching... something big, that splashed into the water.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Just see where it carries to!&amp;rdquo; a soldier near by said sternly, looking round at the sound.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Encouraging us to get along quicker,&amp;rdquo; said another uneasily.</p>
    <p>The crowd moved on again. Nesvítski realized that it was a cannon ball.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Hey, Cossack, my horse!&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;Now, then, you there! get out of the way! Make way!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>With great difficulty he managed to get to his horse, and shouting continually he moved on. The soldiers squeezed themselves to make way for him, but again pressed on him so that they jammed his leg, and those nearest him were not to blame for they were themselves pressed still harder from behind.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Nesvítski, Nesvítski! you numskull!&amp;rdquo; came a hoarse voice from behind him.</p>
    <p>Nesvítski looked round and saw, some fifteen paces away but separated by the living mass of moving infantry, Váska Denísov, red and shaggy, with his cap on the back of his black head and a cloak hanging jauntily over his shoulder.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Tell these devils, these fiends, to let me pass!&amp;rdquo; shouted Denísov evidently in a fit of rage, his coal-black eyes with their bloodshot whites glittering and rolling as he waved his sheathed saber in a small bare hand as red as his face.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Ah, Váska!&amp;rdquo; joyfully replied Nesvítski. &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s up with you?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;The squadwon can&amp;rsquo;t pass,&amp;rdquo; shouted Váska Denísov, showing his white teeth fiercely and spurring his black thoroughbred Arab, which twitched its ears as the bayonets touched it, and snorted, spurting white foam from his bit, tramping the planks of the bridge with his hoofs, and apparently ready to jump over the railings had his rider let him. &amp;ldquo;What is this? They&amp;rsquo;re like sheep! Just like sheep! Out of the way!... Let us pass!... Stop there, you devil with the cart! I&amp;rsquo;ll hack you with my saber!&amp;rdquo; he shouted, actually drawing his saber from its scabbard and flourishing it.</p>
    <p>The soldiers crowded against one another with terrified faces, and Denísov joined Nesvítski.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;How&amp;rsquo;s it you&amp;rsquo;re not drunk today?&amp;rdquo; said Nesvítski when the other had ridden up to him.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;They don&amp;rsquo;t even give one time to dwink!&amp;rdquo; answered Váska Denísov. &amp;ldquo;They keep dwagging the wegiment to and fwo all day. If they mean to fight, let&amp;rsquo;s fight. But the devil knows what this is.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;What a dandy you are today!&amp;rdquo; said Nesvítski, looking at Denísov&amp;rsquo;s new cloak and saddlecloth.</p>
    <p>Denísov smiled, took out of his sabretache a handkerchief that diffused a smell of perfume, and put it to Nesvítski&amp;rsquo;s nose.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Of course. I&amp;rsquo;m going into action! I&amp;rsquo;ve shaved, bwushed my teeth, and scented myself.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The imposing figure of Nesvítski followed by his Cossack, and the determination of Denísov who flourished his sword and shouted frantically, had such an effect that they managed to squeeze through to the farther side of the bridge and stopped the infantry. Beside the bridge Nesvítski found the colonel to whom he had to deliver the order, and having done this he rode back.</p>
    <p>Having cleared the way Denísov stopped at the end of the bridge. Carelessly holding in his stallion that was neighing and pawing the ground, eager to rejoin its fellows, he watched his squadron draw nearer. Then the clang of hoofs, as of several horses galloping, resounded on the planks of the bridge, and the squadron, officers in front and men four abreast, spread across the bridge and began to emerge on his side of it.</p>
    <p>The infantry who had been stopped crowded near the bridge in the trampled mud and gazed with that particular feeling of ill-will, estrangement, and ridicule with which troops of different arms usually encounter one another at the clean, smart hussars who moved past them in regular order.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Smart lads! Only fit for a fair!&amp;rdquo; said one.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;What good are they? They&amp;rsquo;re led about just for show!&amp;rdquo; remarked another.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t kick up the dust, you infantry!&amp;rdquo; jested an hussar whose prancing horse had splashed mud over some foot soldiers.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;d like to put you on a two days&amp;rsquo; march with a knapsack! Your fine cords would soon get a bit rubbed,&amp;rdquo; said an infantryman, wiping the mud off his face with his sleeve. &amp;ldquo;Perched up there, you&amp;rsquo;re more like a bird than a man.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;There now, Zíkin, they ought to put you on a horse. You&amp;rsquo;d look fine,&amp;rdquo; said a corporal, chaffing a thin little soldier who bent under the weight of his knapsack.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Take a stick between your legs, that&amp;rsquo;ll suit you for a horse!&amp;rdquo; the hussar shouted back.</p>
    <h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
    <p>The last of the infantry hurriedly crossed the bridge, squeezing together as they approached it as if passing through a funnel. At last the baggage wagons had all crossed, the crush was less, and the last battalion came onto the bridge. Only Denísov&amp;rsquo;s squadron of hussars remained on the farther side of the bridge facing the enemy, who could be seen from the hill on the opposite bank but was not yet visible from the bridge, for the horizon as seen from the valley through which the river flowed was formed by the rising ground only half a mile away. At the foot of the hill lay wasteland over which a few groups of our Cossack scouts were moving. Suddenly on the road at the top of the high ground, artillery and troops in blue uniform were seen. These were the French. A group of Cossack scouts retired down the hill at a trot. All the officers and men of Denísov&amp;rsquo;s squadron, though they tried to talk of other things and to look in other directions, thought only of what was there on the hilltop, and kept constantly looking at the patches appearing on the skyline, which they knew to be the enemy&amp;rsquo;s troops. The weather had cleared again since noon and the sun was descending brightly upon the Danube and the dark hills around it. It was calm, and at intervals the bugle calls and the shouts of the enemy could be heard from the hill. There was no one now between the squadron and the enemy except a few scattered skirmishers. An empty space of some seven hundred yards was all that separated them. The enemy ceased firing, and that stern, threatening, inaccessible, and intangible line which separates two hostile armies was all the more clearly felt.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;One step beyond that boundary line which resembles the line dividing the living from the dead lies uncertainty, suffering, and death. And what is there? Who is there?&amp;mdash;there beyond that field, that tree, that roof lit up by the sun? No one knows, but one wants to know. You fear and yet long to cross that line, and know that sooner or later it must be crossed and you will have to find out what is there, just as you will inevitably have to learn what lies the other side of death. But you are strong, healthy, cheerful, and excited, and are surrounded by other such excitedly animated and healthy men.&amp;rdquo; So thinks, or at any rate feels, anyone who comes in sight of the enemy, and that feeling gives a particular glamour and glad keenness of impression to everything that takes place at such moments.</p>
    <p>On the high ground where the enemy was, the smoke of a cannon rose, and a ball flew whistling over the heads of the hussar squadron. The officers who had been standing together rode off to their places. The hussars began carefully aligning their horses. Silence fell on the whole squadron. All were looking at the enemy in front and at the squadron commander, awaiting the word of command. A second and a third cannon ball flew past. Evidently they were firing at the hussars, but the balls with rapid rhythmic whistle flew over the heads of the horsemen and fell somewhere beyond them. The hussars did not look round, but at the sound of each shot, as at the word of command, the whole squadron with its rows of faces so alike yet so different, holding its breath while the ball flew past, rose in the stirrups and sank back again. The soldiers without turning their heads glanced at one another, curious to see their comrades&amp;rsquo; impression. Every face, from Denísov&amp;rsquo;s to that of the bugler, showed one common expression of conflict, irritation, and excitement, around chin and mouth. The quartermaster frowned, looking at the soldiers as if threatening to punish them. Cadet Mirónov ducked every time a ball flew past. Rostóv on the left flank, mounted on his Rook&amp;mdash;a handsome horse despite its game leg&amp;mdash;had the happy air of a schoolboy called up before a large audience for an examination in which he feels sure he will distinguish himself. He was glancing at everyone with a clear, bright expression, as if asking them to notice how calmly he sat under fire. But despite himself, on his face too that same indication of something new and stern showed round the mouth.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Who&amp;rsquo;s that curtseying there? Cadet Miwónov! That&amp;rsquo;s not wight! Look at me,&amp;rdquo; cried Denísov who, unable to keep still on one spot, kept turning his horse in front of the squadron.</p>
    <p>The black, hairy, snub-nosed face of Váska Denísov, and his whole short sturdy figure with the sinewy hairy hand and stumpy fingers in which he held the hilt of his naked saber, looked just as it usually did, especially toward evening when he had emptied his second bottle; he was only redder than usual. With his shaggy head thrown back like birds when they drink, pressing his spurs mercilessly into the sides of his good horse, Bedouin, and sitting as though falling backwards in the saddle, he galloped to the other flank of the squadron and shouted in a hoarse voice to the men to look to their pistols. He rode up to Kírsten. The staff captain on his broad-backed, steady mare came at a walk to meet him. His face with its long mustache was serious as always, only his eyes were brighter than usual.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well, what about it?&amp;rdquo; said he to Denísov. &amp;ldquo;It won&amp;rsquo;t come to a fight. You&amp;rsquo;ll see&amp;mdash;we shall retire.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;The devil only knows what they&amp;rsquo;re about!&amp;rdquo; muttered Denísov. &amp;ldquo;Ah, Wostóv,&amp;rdquo; he cried noticing the cadet&amp;rsquo;s bright face, &amp;ldquo;you&amp;rsquo;ve got it at last.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>And he smiled approvingly, evidently pleased with the cadet. Rostóv felt perfectly happy. Just then the commander appeared on the bridge. Denísov galloped up to him.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Your excellency! Let us attack them! I&amp;rsquo;ll dwive them off.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Attack indeed!&amp;rdquo; said the colonel in a bored voice, puckering up his face as if driving off a troublesome fly. &amp;ldquo;And why are you stopping here? Don&amp;rsquo;t you see the skirmishers are retreating? Lead the squadron back.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The squadron crossed the bridge and drew out of range of fire without having lost a single man. The second squadron that had been in the front line followed them across and the last Cossacks quitted the farther side of the river.</p>
    <p>The two Pávlograd squadrons, having crossed the bridge, retired up the hill one after the other. Their colonel, Karl Bogdánich Schubert, came up to Denísov&amp;rsquo;s squadron and rode at a footpace not far from Rostóv, without taking any notice of him although they were now meeting for the first time since their encounter concerning Telyánin. Rostóv, feeling that he was at the front and in the power of a man toward whom he now admitted that he had been to blame, did not lift his eyes from the colonel&amp;rsquo;s athletic back, his nape covered with light hair, and his red neck. It seemed to Rostóv that Bogdánich was only pretending not to notice him, and that his whole aim now was to test the cadet&amp;rsquo;s courage, so he drew himself up and looked around him merrily; then it seemed to him that Bogdánich rode so near in order to show him his courage. Next he thought that his enemy would send the squadron on a desperate attack just to punish him&amp;mdash;Rostóv. Then he imagined how, after the attack, Bogdánich would come up to him as he lay wounded and would magnanimously extend the hand of reconciliation.</p>
    <p>The high-shouldered figure of Zherkóv, familiar to the Pávlograds as he had but recently left their regiment, rode up to the colonel. After his dismissal from headquarters Zherkóv had not remained in the regiment, saying he was not such a fool as to slave at the front when he could get more rewards by doing nothing on the staff, and had succeeded in attaching himself as an orderly officer to Prince Bagratión. He now came to his former chief with an order from the commander of the rear guard.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Colonel,&amp;rdquo; he said, addressing Rostóv&amp;rsquo;s enemy with an air of gloomy gravity and glancing round at his comrades, &amp;ldquo;there is an order to stop and fire the bridge.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;An order to who?&amp;rdquo; asked the colonel morosely.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t myself know &amp;lsquo;to who,&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo; replied the cornet in a serious tone, &amp;ldquo;but the prince told me to &amp;lsquo;go and tell the colonel that the hussars must return quickly and fire the bridge.&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Zherkóv was followed by an officer of the suite who rode up to the colonel of hussars with the same order. After him the stout Nesvítski came galloping up on a Cossack horse that could scarcely carry his weight.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;How&amp;rsquo;s this, Colonel?&amp;rdquo; he shouted as he approached. &amp;ldquo;I told you to fire the bridge, and now someone has gone and blundered; they are all beside themselves over there and one can&amp;rsquo;t make anything out.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The colonel deliberately stopped the regiment and turned to Nesvítski.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;You spoke to me of inflammable material,&amp;rdquo; said he, &amp;ldquo;but you said nothing about firing it.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;But, my dear sir,&amp;rdquo; said Nesvítski as he drew up, taking off his cap and smoothing his hair wet with perspiration with his plump hand, &amp;ldquo;wasn&amp;rsquo;t I telling you to fire the bridge, when inflammable material had been put in position?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I am not your &amp;lsquo;dear sir,&amp;rsquo; Mr. Staff Officer, and you did not tell me to burn the bridge! I know the service, and it is my habit orders strictly to obey. You said the bridge would be burned, but who would it burn, I could not know by the holy spirit!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Ah, that&amp;rsquo;s always the way!&amp;rdquo; said Nesvítski with a wave of the hand. &amp;ldquo;How did you get here?&amp;rdquo; said he, turning to Zherkóv.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;On the same business. But you <i>are</i> damp! Let me wring you out!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;You were saying, Mr. Staff Officer...&amp;rdquo; continued the colonel in an offended tone.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Colonel,&amp;rdquo; interrupted the officer of the suite, &amp;ldquo;You must be quick or the enemy will bring up his guns to use grapeshot.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The colonel looked silently at the officer of the suite, at the stout staff officer, and at Zherkóv, and he frowned.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I will the bridge fire,&amp;rdquo; he said in a solemn tone as if to announce that in spite of all the unpleasantness he had to endure he would still do the right thing.</p>
    <p>Striking his horse with his long muscular legs as if it were to blame for everything, the colonel moved forward and ordered the second squadron, that in which Rostóv was serving under Denísov, to return to the bridge.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;There, it&amp;rsquo;s just as I thought,&amp;rdquo; said Rostóv to himself. &amp;ldquo;He wishes to test me!&amp;rdquo; His heart contracted and the blood rushed to his face. &amp;ldquo;Let him see whether I am a coward!&amp;rdquo; he thought.</p>
    <p>Again on all the bright faces of the squadron the serious expression appeared that they had worn when under fire. Rostóv watched his enemy, the colonel, closely&amp;mdash;to find in his face confirmation of his own conjecture, but the colonel did not once glance at Rostóv, and looked as he always did when at the front, solemn and stern. Then came the word of command.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Look sharp! Look sharp!&amp;rdquo; several voices repeated around him.</p>
    <p>Their sabers catching in the bridles and their spurs jingling, the hussars hastily dismounted, not knowing what they were to do. The men were crossing themselves. Rostóv no longer looked at the colonel, he had no time. He was afraid of falling behind the hussars, so much afraid that his heart stood still. His hand trembled as he gave his horse into an orderly&amp;rsquo;s charge, and he felt the blood rush to his heart with a thud. Denísov rode past him, leaning back and shouting something. Rostóv saw nothing but the hussars running all around him, their spurs catching and their sabers clattering.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Stretchers!&amp;rdquo; shouted someone behind him.</p>
    <p>Rostóv did not think what this call for stretchers meant; he ran on, trying only to be ahead of the others; but just at the bridge, not looking at the ground, he came on some sticky, trodden mud, stumbled, and fell on his hands. The others outstripped him.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;At boss zides, Captain,&amp;rdquo; he heard the voice of the colonel, who, having ridden ahead, had pulled up his horse near the bridge, with a triumphant, cheerful face.</p>
    <p>Rostóv wiping his muddy hands on his breeches looked at his enemy and was about to run on, thinking that the farther he went to the front the better. But Bogdánich, without looking at or recognizing Rostóv, shouted to him:</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Who&amp;rsquo;s that running on the middle of the bridge? To the right! Come back, Cadet!&amp;rdquo; he cried angrily; and turning to Denísov, who, showing off his courage, had ridden on to the planks of the bridge:</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Why run risks, Captain? You should dismount,&amp;rdquo; he said.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Oh, every bullet has its billet,&amp;rdquo; answered Váska Denísov, turning in his saddle.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile Nesvítski, Zherkóv, and the officer of the suite were standing together out of range of the shots, watching, now the small group of men with yellow shakos, dark-green jackets braided with cord, and blue riding breeches, who were swarming near the bridge, and then at what was approaching in the distance from the opposite side&amp;mdash;the blue uniforms and groups with horses, easily recognizable as artillery.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Will they burn the bridge or not? Who&amp;rsquo;ll get there first? Will they get there and fire the bridge or will the French get within grapeshot range and wipe them out?&amp;rdquo; These were the questions each man of the troops on the high ground above the bridge involuntarily asked himself with a sinking heart&amp;mdash;watching the bridge and the hussars in the bright evening light and the blue tunics advancing from the other side with their bayonets and guns.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Ugh. The hussars will get it hot!&amp;rdquo; said Nesvítski; &amp;ldquo;they are within grapeshot range now.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;He shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have taken so many men,&amp;rdquo; said the officer of the suite.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;True enough,&amp;rdquo; answered Nesvítski; &amp;ldquo;two smart fellows could have done the job just as well.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Ah, your excellency,&amp;rdquo; put in Zherkóv, his eyes fixed on the hussars, but still with that naïve air that made it impossible to know whether he was speaking in jest or in earnest. &amp;ldquo;Ah, your excellency! How you look at things! Send two men? And who then would give us the Vladímir medal and ribbon? But now, even if they do get peppered, the squadron may be recommended for honors and he may get a ribbon. Our Bogdánich knows how things are done.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;There now!&amp;rdquo; said the officer of the suite, &amp;ldquo;that&amp;rsquo;s grapeshot.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>He pointed to the French guns, the limbers of which were being detached and hurriedly removed.</p>
    <p>On the French side, amid the groups with cannon, a cloud of smoke appeared, then a second and a third almost simultaneously, and at the moment when the first report was heard a fourth was seen. Then two reports one after another, and a third.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Oh! Oh!&amp;rdquo; groaned Nesvítski as if in fierce pain, seizing the officer of the suite by the arm. &amp;ldquo;Look! A man has fallen! Fallen, fallen!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Two, I think.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;If I were Tsar I would never go to war,&amp;rdquo; said Nesvítski, turning away.</p>
    <p>The French guns were hastily reloaded. The infantry in their blue uniforms advanced toward the bridge at a run. Smoke appeared again but at irregular intervals, and grapeshot cracked and rattled onto the bridge. But this time Nesvítski could not see what was happening there, as a dense cloud of smoke arose from it. The hussars had succeeded in setting it on fire and the French batteries were now firing at them, no longer to hinder them but because the guns were trained and there was someone to fire at.</p>
    <p>The French had time to fire three rounds of grapeshot before the hussars got back to their horses. Two were misdirected and the shot went too high, but the last round fell in the midst of a group of hussars and knocked three of them over.</p>
    <p>Rostóv, absorbed by his relations with Bogdánich, had paused on the bridge not knowing what to do. There was no one to hew down (as he had always imagined battles to himself), nor could he help to fire the bridge because he had not brought any burning straw with him like the other soldiers. He stood looking about him, when suddenly he heard a rattle on the bridge as if nuts were being spilt, and the hussar nearest to him fell against the rails with a groan. Rostóv ran up to him with the others. Again someone shouted, &amp;ldquo;Stretchers!&amp;rdquo; Four men seized the hussar and began lifting him.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Oooh! For Christ&amp;rsquo;s sake let me alone!&amp;rdquo; cried the wounded man, but still he was lifted and laid on the stretcher.</p>
    <p>Nicholas Rostóv turned away and, as if searching for something, gazed into the distance, at the waters of the Danube, at the sky, and at the sun. How beautiful the sky looked; how blue, how calm, and how deep! How bright and glorious was the setting sun! With what soft glitter the waters of the distant Danube shone. And fairer still were the faraway blue mountains beyond the river, the nunnery, the mysterious gorges, and the pine forests veiled in the mist of their summits... There was peace and happiness... &amp;ldquo;I should wish for nothing else, nothing, if only I were there,&amp;rdquo; thought Rostóv. &amp;ldquo;In myself alone and in that sunshine there is so much happiness; but here... groans, suffering, fear, and this uncertainty and hurry... There&amp;mdash;they are shouting again, and again are all running back somewhere, and I shall run with them, and it, death, is here above me and around... Another instant and I shall never again see the sun, this water, that gorge!...&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>At that instant the sun began to hide behind the clouds, and other stretchers came into view before Rostóv. And the fear of death and of the stretchers, and love of the sun and of life, all merged into one feeling of sickening agitation.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;O Lord God! Thou who art in that heaven, save, forgive, and protect me!&amp;rdquo; Rostóv whispered.</p>
    <p>The hussars ran back to the men who held their horses; their voices sounded louder and calmer, the stretchers disappeared from sight.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well, fwiend? So you&amp;rsquo;ve smelt powdah!&amp;rdquo; shouted Váska Denísov just above his ear.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s all over; but I am a coward&amp;mdash;yes, a coward!&amp;rdquo; thought Rostóv, and sighing deeply he took Rook, his horse, which stood resting one foot, from the orderly and began to mount.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Was that grapeshot?&amp;rdquo; he asked Denísov.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Yes and no mistake!&amp;rdquo; cried Denísov. &amp;ldquo;You worked like wegular bwicks and it&amp;rsquo;s nasty work! An attack&amp;rsquo;s pleasant work! Hacking away at the dogs! But this sort of thing is the very devil, with them shooting at you like a target.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>And Denísov rode up to a group that had stopped near Rostóv, composed of the colonel, Nesvítski, Zherkóv, and the officer from the suite.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well, it seems that no one has noticed,&amp;rdquo; thought Rostóv. And this was true. No one had taken any notice, for everyone knew the sensation which the cadet under fire for the first time had experienced.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Here&amp;rsquo;s something for you to report,&amp;rdquo; said Zherkóv. &amp;ldquo;See if I don&amp;rsquo;t get promoted to a sublieutenancy.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Inform the prince that I the bridge fired!&amp;rdquo; said the colonel triumphantly and gaily.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;And if he asks about the losses?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;A trifle,&amp;rdquo; said the colonel in his bass voice: &amp;ldquo;two hussars wounded, and one knocked out,&amp;rdquo; he added, unable to restrain a happy smile, and pronouncing the phrase &amp;ldquo;knocked out&amp;rdquo; with ringing distinctness.</p>
    <h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
    <p>Pursued by the French army of a hundred thousand men under the command of Bonaparte, encountering a population that was unfriendly to it, losing confidence in its allies, suffering from shortness of supplies, and compelled to act under conditions of war unlike anything that had been foreseen, the Russian army of thirty-five thousand men commanded by Kutúzov was hurriedly retreating along the Danube, stopping where overtaken by the enemy and fighting rearguard actions only as far as necessary to enable it to retreat without losing its heavy equipment. There had been actions at Lambach, Amstetten, and Melk; but despite the courage and endurance&amp;mdash;acknowledged even by the enemy&amp;mdash;with which the Russians fought, the only consequence of these actions was a yet more rapid retreat. Austrian troops that had escaped capture at Ulm and had joined Kutúzov at Braunau now separated from the Russian army, and Kutúzov was left with only his own weak and exhausted forces. The defense of Vienna was no longer to be thought of. Instead of an offensive, the plan of which, carefully prepared in accord with the modern science of strategics, had been handed to Kutúzov when he was in Vienna by the Austrian Hofkriegsrath, the sole and almost unattainable aim remaining for him was to effect a junction with the forces that were advancing from Russia, without losing his army as Mack had done at Ulm.</p>
    <p>On the twenty-eighth of October Kutúzov with his army crossed to the left bank of the Danube and took up a position for the first time with the river between himself and the main body of the French. On the thirtieth he attacked Mortier&amp;rsquo;s division, which was on the left bank, and broke it up. In this action for the first time trophies were taken: banners, cannon, and two enemy generals. For the first time, after a fortnight&amp;rsquo;s retreat, the Russian troops had halted and after a fight had not only held the field but had repulsed the French. Though the troops were ill-clad, exhausted, and had lost a third of their number in killed, wounded, sick, and stragglers; though a number of sick and wounded had been abandoned on the other side of the Danube with a letter in which Kutúzov entrusted them to the humanity of the enemy; and though the big hospitals and the houses in Krems converted into military hospitals could no longer accommodate all the sick and wounded, yet the stand made at Krems and the victory over Mortier raised the spirits of the army considerably. Throughout the whole army and at headquarters most joyful though erroneous rumors were rife of the imaginary approach of columns from Russia, of some victory gained by the Austrians, and of the retreat of the frightened Bonaparte.</p>
    <p>Prince Andrew during the battle had been in attendance on the Austrian General Schmidt, who was killed in the action. His horse had been wounded under him and his own arm slightly grazed by a bullet. As a mark of the commander in chief&amp;rsquo;s special favor he was sent with the news of this victory to the Austrian court, now no longer at Vienna (which was threatened by the French) but at Brünn. Despite his apparently delicate build Prince Andrew could endure physical fatigue far better than many very muscular men, and on the night of the battle, having arrived at Krems excited but not weary, with dispatches from Dokhtúrov to Kutúzov, he was sent immediately with a special dispatch to Brünn. To be so sent meant not only a reward but an important step toward promotion.</p>
    <p>The night was dark but starry, the road showed black in the snow that had fallen the previous day&amp;mdash;the day of the battle. Reviewing his impressions of the recent battle, picturing pleasantly to himself the impression his news of a victory would create, or recalling the send-off given him by the commander in chief and his fellow officers, Prince Andrew was galloping along in a post chaise enjoying the feelings of a man who has at length begun to attain a long-desired happiness. As soon as he closed his eyes his ears seemed filled with the rattle of the wheels and the sensation of victory. Then he began to imagine that the Russians were running away and that he himself was killed, but he quickly roused himself with a feeling of joy, as if learning afresh that this was not so but that on the contrary the French had run away. He again recalled all the details of the victory and his own calm courage during the battle, and feeling reassured he dozed off.... The dark starry night was followed by a bright cheerful morning. The snow was thawing in the sunshine, the horses galloped quickly, and on both sides of the road were forests of different kinds, fields, and villages.</p>
    <p>At one of the post stations he overtook a convoy of Russian wounded. The Russian officer in charge of the transport lolled back in the front cart, shouting and scolding a soldier with coarse abuse. In each of the long German carts six or more pale, dirty, bandaged men were being jolted over the stony road. Some of them were talking (he heard Russian words), others were eating bread; the more severely wounded looked silently, with the languid interest of sick children, at the envoy hurrying past them.</p>
    <p>Prince Andrew told his driver to stop, and asked a soldier in what action they had been wounded. &amp;ldquo;Day before yesterday, on the Danube,&amp;rdquo; answered the soldier. Prince Andrew took out his purse and gave the soldier three gold pieces.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s for them all,&amp;rdquo; he said to the officer who came up.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Get well soon, lads!&amp;rdquo; he continued, turning to the soldiers. &amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s plenty to do still.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;What news, sir?&amp;rdquo; asked the officer, evidently anxious to start a conversation.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Good news!... Go on!&amp;rdquo; he shouted to the driver, and they galloped on.</p>
    <p>It was already quite dark when Prince Andrew rattled over the paved streets of Brünn and found himself surrounded by high buildings, the lights of shops, houses, and street lamps, fine carriages, and all that atmosphere of a large and active town which is always so attractive to a soldier after camp life. Despite his rapid journey and sleepless night, Prince Andrew when he drove up to the palace felt even more vigorous and alert than he had done the day before. Only his eyes gleamed feverishly and his thoughts followed one another with extraordinary clearness and rapidity. He again vividly recalled the details of the battle, no longer dim, but definite and in the concise form in which he imagined himself stating them to the Emperor Francis. He vividly imagined the casual questions that might be put to him and the answers he would give. He expected to be at once presented to the Emperor. At the chief entrance to the palace, however, an official came running out to meet him, and learning that he was a special messenger led him to another entrance.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;To the right from the corridor, <i>Euer Hochgeboren!</i> There you will find the adjutant on duty,&amp;rdquo; said the official. &amp;ldquo;He will conduct you to the Minister of War.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The adjutant on duty, meeting Prince Andrew, asked him to wait, and went in to the Minister of War. Five minutes later he returned and bowing with particular courtesy ushered Prince Andrew before him along a corridor to the cabinet where the Minister of War was at work. The adjutant by his elaborate courtesy appeared to wish to ward off any attempt at familiarity on the part of the Russian messenger.</p>
    <p>Prince Andrew&amp;rsquo;s joyous feeling was considerably weakened as he approached the door of the minister&amp;rsquo;s room. He felt offended, and without his noticing it the feeling of offense immediately turned into one of disdain which was quite uncalled for. His fertile mind instantly suggested to him a point of view which gave him a right to despise the adjutant and the minister. &amp;ldquo;Away from the smell of powder, they probably think it easy to gain victories!&amp;rdquo; he thought. His eyes narrowed disdainfully, he entered the room of the Minister of War with peculiarly deliberate steps. This feeling of disdain was heightened when he saw the minister seated at a large table reading some papers and making pencil notes on them, and for the first two or three minutes taking no notice of his arrival. A wax candle stood at each side of the minister&amp;rsquo;s bent bald head with its gray temples. He went on reading to the end, without raising his eyes at the opening of the door and the sound of footsteps.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Take this and deliver it,&amp;rdquo; said he to his adjutant, handing him the papers and still taking no notice of the special messenger.</p>
    <p>Prince Andrew felt that either the actions of Kutúzov&amp;rsquo;s army interested the Minister of War less than any of the other matters he was concerned with, or he wanted to give the Russian special messenger that impression. &amp;ldquo;But that is a matter of perfect indifference to me,&amp;rdquo; he thought. The minister drew the remaining papers together, arranged them evenly, and then raised his head. He had an intellectual and distinctive head, but the instant he turned to Prince Andrew the firm, intelligent expression on his face changed in a way evidently deliberate and habitual to him. His face took on the stupid artificial smile (which does not even attempt to hide its artificiality) of a man who is continually receiving many petitioners one after another.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;From General Field Marshal Kutúzov?&amp;rdquo; he asked. &amp;ldquo;I hope it is good news? There has been an encounter with Mortier? A victory? It was high time!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>He took the dispatch which was addressed to him and began to read it with a mournful expression.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Oh, my God! My God! Schmidt!&amp;rdquo; he exclaimed in German. &amp;ldquo;What a calamity! What a calamity!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Having glanced through the dispatch he laid it on the table and looked at Prince Andrew, evidently considering something.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Ah what a calamity! You say the affair was decisive? But Mortier is not captured.&amp;rdquo; Again he pondered. &amp;ldquo;I am very glad you have brought good news, though Schmidt&amp;rsquo;s death is a heavy price to pay for the victory. His Majesty will no doubt wish to see you, but not today. I thank you! You must have a rest. Be at the levee tomorrow after the parade. However, I will let you know.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The stupid smile, which had left his face while he was speaking, reappeared.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;<i>Au revoir!</i> Thank you very much. His Majesty will probably desire to see you,&amp;rdquo; he added, bowing his head.</p>
    <p>When Prince Andrew left the palace he felt that all the interest and happiness the victory had afforded him had been now left in the indifferent hands of the Minister of War and the polite adjutant. The whole tenor of his thoughts instantaneously changed; the battle seemed the memory of a remote event long past.</p>
    <h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
    <p>Prince Andrew stayed at Brünn with Bilíbin, a Russian acquaintance of his in the diplomatic service.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Ah, my dear prince! I could not have a more welcome visitor,&amp;rdquo; said Bilíbin as he came out to meet Prince Andrew. &amp;ldquo;Franz, put the prince&amp;rsquo;s things in my bedroom,&amp;rdquo; said he to the servant who was ushering Bolkónski in. &amp;ldquo;So you&amp;rsquo;re a messenger of victory, eh? Splendid! And I am sitting here ill, as you see.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>After washing and dressing, Prince Andrew came into the diplomat&amp;rsquo;s luxurious study and sat down to the dinner prepared for him. Bilíbin settled down comfortably beside the fire.</p>
    <p>After his journey and the campaign during which he had been deprived of all the comforts of cleanliness and all the refinements of life, Prince Andrew felt a pleasant sense of repose among luxurious surroundings such as he had been accustomed to from childhood. Besides it was pleasant, after his reception by the Austrians, to speak if not in Russian (for they were speaking French) at least with a Russian who would, he supposed, share the general Russian antipathy to the Austrians which was then particularly strong.</p>
    <p>Bilíbin was a man of thirty-five, a bachelor, and of the same circle as Prince Andrew. They had known each other previously in Petersburg, but had become more intimate when Prince Andrew was in Vienna with Kutúzov. Just as Prince Andrew was a young man who gave promise of rising high in the military profession, so to an even greater extent Bilíbin gave promise of rising in his diplomatic career. He still a young man but no longer a young diplomat, as he had entered the service at the age of sixteen, had been in Paris and Copenhagen, and now held a rather important post in Vienna. Both the foreign minister and our ambassador in Vienna knew him and valued him. He was not one of those many diplomats who are esteemed because they have certain negative qualities, avoid doing certain things, and speak French. He was one of those, who, liking work, knew how to do it, and despite his indolence would sometimes spend a whole night at his writing table. He worked well whatever the import of his work. It was not the question &amp;ldquo;What for?&amp;rdquo; but the question &amp;ldquo;How?&amp;rdquo; that interested him. What the diplomatic matter might be he did not care, but it gave him great pleasure to prepare a circular, memorandum, or report, skillfully, pointedly, and elegantly. Bilíbin&amp;rsquo;s services were valued not only for what he wrote, but also for his skill in dealing and conversing with those in the highest spheres.</p>
    <p>Bilíbin liked conversation as he liked work, only when it could be made elegantly witty. In society he always awaited an opportunity to say something striking and took part in a conversation only when that was possible. His conversation was always sprinkled with wittily original, finished phrases of general interest. These sayings were prepared in the inner laboratory of his mind in a portable form as if intentionally, so that insignificant society people might carry them from drawing room to drawing room. And, in fact, Bilíbin&amp;rsquo;s witticisms were hawked about in the Viennese drawing rooms and often had an influence on matters considered important.</p>
    <p>His thin, worn, sallow face was covered with deep wrinkles, which always looked as clean and well washed as the tips of one&amp;rsquo;s fingers after a Russian bath. The movement of these wrinkles formed the principal play of expression on his face. Now his forehead would pucker into deep folds and his eyebrows were lifted, then his eyebrows would descend and deep wrinkles would crease his cheeks. His small, deep-set eyes always twinkled and looked out straight.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well, now tell me about your exploits,&amp;rdquo; said he.</p>
    <p>Bolkónski, very modestly without once mentioning himself, described the engagement and his reception by the Minister of War.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;They received me and my news as one receives a dog in a game of skittles,&amp;rdquo; said he in conclusion.</p>
    <p>Bilíbin smiled and the wrinkles on his face disappeared.</p>
    <p><i>&amp;ldquo;Cependant, mon cher,&amp;rdquo;</i> he remarked, examining his nails from a distance and puckering the skin above his left eye, <i>&amp;ldquo;malgré la haute estime que je professe pour</i> the Orthodox Russian army, <i>j&amp;rsquo;avoue que votre victoire n&amp;rsquo;est pas des plus victorieuses.&amp;rdquo;</i> *</p>
    <pre class="testable">* &amp;ldquo;But my dear fellow, with all my respect for the Orthodox Russian army, I must say that your victory was not particularly victorious.&amp;rdquo;</pre>
    <p>He went on talking in this way in French, uttering only those words in Russian on which he wished to put a contemptuous emphasis.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Come now! You with all your forces fall on the unfortunate Mortier and his one division, and even then Mortier slips through your fingers! Where&amp;rsquo;s the victory?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;But seriously,&amp;rdquo; said Prince Andrew, &amp;ldquo;we can at any rate say without boasting that it was a little better than at Ulm...&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Why didn&amp;rsquo;t you capture one, just one, marshal for us?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Because not everything happens as one expects or with the smoothness of a parade. We had expected, as I told you, to get at their rear by seven in the morning but had not reached it by five in the afternoon.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;And why didn&amp;rsquo;t you do it at seven in the morning? You ought to have been there at seven in the morning,&amp;rdquo; returned Bilíbin with a smile. &amp;ldquo;You ought to have been there at seven in the morning.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Why did you not succeed in impressing on Bonaparte by diplomatic methods that he had better leave Genoa alone?&amp;rdquo; retorted Prince Andrew in the same tone.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I know,&amp;rdquo; interrupted Bilíbin, &amp;ldquo;you&amp;rsquo;re thinking it&amp;rsquo;s very easy to take marshals, sitting on a sofa by the fire! That is true, but still why didn&amp;rsquo;t you capture him? So don&amp;rsquo;t be surprised if not only the Minister of War but also his Most August Majesty the Emperor and King Francis is not much delighted by your victory. Even I, a poor secretary of the Russian Embassy, do not feel any need in token of my joy to give my Franz a thaler, or let him go with his <i>Liebchen</i> to the Prater... True, we have no Prater here...&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>He looked straight at Prince Andrew and suddenly unwrinkled his forehead.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;It is now my turn to ask you &amp;lsquo;why?&amp;rsquo; <i>mon cher</i>,&amp;rdquo; said Bolkónski. &amp;ldquo;I confess I do not understand: perhaps there are diplomatic subtleties here beyond my feeble intelligence, but I can&amp;rsquo;t make it out. Mack loses a whole army, the Archduke Ferdinand and the Archduke Karl give no signs of life and make blunder after blunder. Kutúzov alone at last gains a real victory, destroying the spell of the invincibility of the French, and the Minister of War does not even care to hear the details.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s just it, my dear fellow. You see it&amp;rsquo;s <i>hurrah</i> for the Tsar, for Russia, for the Orthodox Greek faith! All that is beautiful, but what do we, I mean the Austrian court, care for your victories? Bring us nice news of a victory by the Archduke Karl or Ferdinand (one archduke&amp;rsquo;s as good as another, as you know) and even if it is only over a fire brigade of Bonaparte&amp;rsquo;s, that will be another story and we&amp;rsquo;ll fire off some cannon! But this sort of thing seems done on purpose to vex us. The Archduke Karl does nothing, the Archduke Ferdinand disgraces himself. You abandon Vienna, give up its defense&amp;mdash;as much as to say: &amp;lsquo;Heaven is with us, but heaven help you and your capital!&amp;rsquo; The one general whom we all loved, Schmidt, you expose to a bullet, and then you congratulate us on the victory! Admit that more irritating news than yours could not have been conceived. It&amp;rsquo;s as if it had been done on purpose, on purpose. Besides, suppose you did gain a brilliant victory, if even the Archduke Karl gained a victory, what effect would that have on the general course of events? It&amp;rsquo;s too late now when Vienna is occupied by the French army!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;What? Occupied? Vienna occupied?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Not only occupied, but Bonaparte is at Schönbrunn, and the count, our dear Count Vrbna, goes to him for orders.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>After the fatigues and impressions of the journey, his reception, and especially after having dined, Bolkónski felt that he could not take in the full significance of the words he heard.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Count Lichtenfels was here this morning,&amp;rdquo; Bilíbin continued, &amp;ldquo;and showed me a letter in which the parade of the French in Vienna was fully described: Prince Murat <i>et tout le tremblement</i>... You see that your victory is not a matter for great rejoicing and that you can&amp;rsquo;t be received as a savior.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Really I don&amp;rsquo;t care about that, I don&amp;rsquo;t care at all,&amp;rdquo; said Prince Andrew, beginning to understand that his news of the battle before Krems was really of small importance in view of such events as the fall of Austria&amp;rsquo;s capital. &amp;ldquo;How is it Vienna was taken? What of the bridge and its celebrated bridgehead and Prince Auersperg? We heard reports that Prince Auersperg was defending Vienna?&amp;rdquo; he said.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Prince Auersperg is on this, on our side of the river, and is defending us&amp;mdash;doing it very badly, I think, but still he is defending us. But Vienna is on the other side. No, the bridge has not yet been taken and I hope it will not be, for it is mined and orders have been given to blow it up. Otherwise we should long ago have been in the mountains of Bohemia, and you and your army would have spent a bad quarter of an hour between two fires.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;But still this does not mean that the campaign is over,&amp;rdquo; said Prince Andrew.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well, I think it is. The bigwigs here think so too, but they daren&amp;rsquo;t say so. It will be as I said at the beginning of the campaign, it won&amp;rsquo;t be your skirmishing at Dürrenstein, or gunpowder at all, that will decide the matter, but those who devised it,&amp;rdquo; said Bilíbin quoting one of his own mots, releasing the wrinkles on his forehead, and pausing. &amp;ldquo;The only question is what will come of the meeting between the Emperor Alexander and the King of Prussia in Berlin? If Prussia joins the Allies, Austria&amp;rsquo;s hand will be forced and there will be war. If not it is merely a question of settling where the preliminaries of the new Campo Formio are to be drawn up.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;What an extraordinary genius!&amp;rdquo; Prince Andrew suddenly exclaimed, clenching his small hand and striking the table with it, &amp;ldquo;and what luck the man has!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Buonaparte?&amp;rdquo; said Bilíbin inquiringly, puckering up his forehead to indicate that he was about to say something witty. &amp;ldquo;Buonaparte?&amp;rdquo; he repeated, accentuating the <i>u</i>: &amp;ldquo;I think, however, now that he lays down laws for Austria at Schönbrunn, <i>il faut lui faire grâce de l&amp;rsquo;u!</i> * I shall certainly adopt an innovation and call him simply Bonaparte!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <pre class="testable">* &amp;ldquo;We must let him off the u!&amp;rdquo;</pre>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;But joking apart,&amp;rdquo; said Prince Andrew, &amp;ldquo;do you really think the campaign is over?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;This is what I think. Austria has been made a fool of, and she is not used to it. She will retaliate. And she has been fooled in the first place because her provinces have been pillaged&amp;mdash;they say the Holy Russian army loots terribly&amp;mdash;her army is destroyed, her capital taken, and all this for the <i>beaux yeux</i> * of His Sardinian Majesty. And therefore&amp;mdash;this is between ourselves&amp;mdash;I instinctively feel that we are being deceived, my instinct tells me of negotiations with France and projects for peace, a secret peace concluded separately.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <pre class="testable">* Fine eyes.</pre>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Impossible!&amp;rdquo; cried Prince Andrew. &amp;ldquo;That would be too base.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;If we live we shall see,&amp;rdquo; replied Bilíbin, his face again becoming smooth as a sign that the conversation was at an end.</p>
    <p>When Prince Andrew reached the room prepared for him and lay down in a clean shirt on the feather bed with its warmed and fragrant pillows, he felt that the battle of which he had brought tidings was far, far away from him. The alliance with Prussia, Austria&amp;rsquo;s treachery, Bonaparte&amp;rsquo;s new triumph, tomorrow&amp;rsquo;s levee and parade, and the audience with the Emperor Francis occupied his thoughts.</p>
    <p>He closed his eyes, and immediately a sound of cannonading, of musketry and the rattling of carriage wheels seemed to fill his ears, and now again drawn out in a thin line the musketeers were descending the hill, the French were firing, and he felt his heart palpitating as he rode forward beside Schmidt with the bullets merrily whistling all around, and he experienced tenfold the joy of living, as he had not done since childhood.</p>
    <p>He woke up...</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Yes, that all happened!&amp;rdquo; he said, and, smiling happily to himself like a child, he fell into a deep, youthful slumber.</p>
    <h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
    <p>Next day he woke late. Recalling his recent impressions, the first thought that came into his mind was that today he had to be presented to the Emperor Francis; he remembered the Minister of War, the polite Austrian adjutant, Bilíbin, and last night&amp;rsquo;s conversation. Having dressed for his attendance at court in full parade uniform, which he had not worn for a long time, he went into Bilíbin&amp;rsquo;s study fresh, animated, and handsome, with his hand bandaged. In the study were four gentlemen of the diplomatic corps. With Prince Hippolyte Kurágin, who was a secretary to the embassy, Bolkónski was already acquainted. Bilíbin introduced him to the others.</p>
    <p>The gentlemen assembled at Bilíbin&amp;rsquo;s were young, wealthy, gay society men, who here, as in Vienna, formed a special set which Bilíbin, their leader, called <i>les nôtres</i>. * This set, consisting almost exclusively of diplomats, evidently had its own interests which had nothing to do with war or politics but related to high society, to certain women, and to the official side of the service. These gentlemen received Prince Andrew as one of themselves, an honor they did not extend to many. From politeness and to start conversation, they asked him a few questions about the army and the battle, and then the talk went off into merry jests and gossip.</p>
    <pre class="testable">* Ours.</pre>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;But the best of it was,&amp;rdquo; said one, telling of the misfortune of a fellow diplomat, &amp;ldquo;that the Chancellor told him flatly that his appointment to London was a promotion and that he was so to regard it. Can you fancy the figure he cut?...&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;But the worst of it, gentlemen&amp;mdash;I am giving Kurágin away to you&amp;mdash;is that that man suffers, and this Don Juan, wicked fellow, is taking advantage of it!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Prince Hippolyte was lolling in a lounge chair with his legs over its arm. He began to laugh.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Tell me about that!&amp;rdquo; he said.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Oh, you Don Juan! You serpent!&amp;rdquo; cried several voices.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;You, Bolkónski, don&amp;rsquo;t know,&amp;rdquo; said Bilíbin turning to Prince Andrew, &amp;ldquo;that all the atrocities of the French army (I nearly said of the Russian army) are nothing compared to what this man has been doing among the women!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p><i>&amp;ldquo;La femme est la compagne de l&amp;rsquo;homme,&amp;rdquo;</i> * announced Prince Hippolyte, and began looking through a lorgnette at his elevated legs.</p>
    <pre class="testable">* &amp;ldquo;Woman is man&amp;rsquo;s companion.&amp;rdquo;</pre>
    <p>Bilíbin and the rest of &amp;ldquo;ours&amp;rdquo; burst out laughing in Hippolyte&amp;rsquo;s face, and Prince Andrew saw that Hippolyte, of whom&amp;mdash;he had to admit&amp;mdash;he had almost been jealous on his wife&amp;rsquo;s account, was the butt of this set.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Oh, I must give you a treat,&amp;rdquo; Bilíbin whispered to Bolkónski. &amp;ldquo;Kurágin is exquisite when he discusses politics&amp;mdash;you should see his gravity!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>He sat down beside Hippolyte and wrinkling his forehead began talking to him about politics. Prince Andrew and the others gathered round these two.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;The Berlin cabinet cannot express a feeling of alliance,&amp;rdquo; began Hippolyte gazing round with importance at the others, &amp;ldquo;without expressing... as in its last note... you understand... Besides, unless His Majesty the Emperor derogates from the principle of our alliance...</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Wait, I have not finished...&amp;rdquo; he said to Prince Andrew, seizing him by the arm, &amp;ldquo;I believe that intervention will be stronger than nonintervention. And...&amp;rdquo; he paused. &amp;ldquo;Finally one cannot impute the nonreceipt of our dispatch of November 18. That is how it will end.&amp;rdquo; And he released Bolkónski&amp;rsquo;s arm to indicate that he had now quite finished.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Demosthenes, I know thee by the pebble thou secretest in thy golden mouth!&amp;rdquo; said Bilíbin, and the mop of hair on his head moved with satisfaction.</p>
    <p>Everybody laughed, and Hippolyte louder than anyone. He was evidently distressed, and breathed painfully, but could not restrain the wild laughter that convulsed his usually impassive features.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well now, gentlemen,&amp;rdquo; said Bilíbin, &amp;ldquo;Bolkónski is my guest in this house and in Brünn itself. I want to entertain him as far as I can, with all the pleasures of life here. If we were in Vienna it would be easy, but here, in this wretched Moravian hole, it is more difficult, and I beg you all to help me. Brünn&amp;rsquo;s attractions must be shown him. You can undertake the theater, I society, and you, Hippolyte, of course the women.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;We must let him see Amelie, she&amp;rsquo;s exquisite!&amp;rdquo; said one of &amp;ldquo;ours,&amp;rdquo; kissing his finger tips.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;In general we must turn this bloodthirsty soldier to more humane interests,&amp;rdquo; said Bilíbin.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I shall scarcely be able to avail myself of your hospitality, gentlemen, it is already time for me to go,&amp;rdquo; replied Prince Andrew looking at his watch.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Where to?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;To the Emperor.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Oh! Oh! Oh!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well, <i>au revoir</i>, Bolkónski! <i>Au revoir</i>, Prince! Come back early to dinner,&amp;rdquo; cried several voices. &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ll take you in hand.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;When speaking to the Emperor, try as far as you can to praise the way that provisions are supplied and the routes indicated,&amp;rdquo; said Bilíbin, accompanying him to the hall.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I should like to speak well of them, but as far as I know the facts, I can&amp;rsquo;t,&amp;rdquo; replied Bolkónski, smiling.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well, talk as much as you can, anyway. He has a passion for giving audiences, but he does not like talking himself and can&amp;rsquo;t do it, as you will see.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
    <p>At the levee Prince Andrew stood among the Austrian officers as he had been told to, and the Emperor Francis merely looked fixedly into his face and just nodded to him with his long head. But after it was over, the adjutant he had seen the previous day ceremoniously informed Bolkónski that the Emperor desired to give him an audience. The Emperor Francis received him standing in the middle of the room. Before the conversation began Prince Andrew was struck by the fact that the Emperor seemed confused and blushed as if not knowing what to say.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Tell me, when did the battle begin?&amp;rdquo; he asked hurriedly.</p>
    <p>Prince Andrew replied. Then followed other questions just as simple: &amp;ldquo;Was Kutúzov well? When had he left Krems?&amp;rdquo; and so on. The Emperor spoke as if his sole aim were to put a given number of questions&amp;mdash;the answers to these questions, as was only too evident, did not interest him.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;At what o&amp;rsquo;clock did the battle begin?&amp;rdquo; asked the Emperor.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I cannot inform Your Majesty at what o&amp;rsquo;clock the battle began at the front, but at Dürrenstein, where I was, our attack began after five in the afternoon,&amp;rdquo; replied Bolkónski growing more animated and expecting that he would have a chance to give a reliable account, which he had ready in his mind, of all he knew and had seen. But the Emperor smiled and interrupted him.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;How many miles?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;From where to where, Your Majesty?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;From Dürrenstein to Krems.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Three and a half miles, Your Majesty.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;The French have abandoned the left bank?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;According to the scouts the last of them crossed on rafts during the night.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Is there sufficient forage in Krems?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Forage has not been supplied to the extent...&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The Emperor interrupted him.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;At what o&amp;rsquo;clock was General Schmidt killed?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;At seven o&amp;rsquo;clock, I believe.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;At seven o&amp;rsquo;clock? It&amp;rsquo;s very sad, very sad!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The Emperor thanked Prince Andrew and bowed. Prince Andrew withdrew and was immediately surrounded by courtiers on all sides. Everywhere he saw friendly looks and heard friendly words. Yesterday&amp;rsquo;s adjutant reproached him for not having stayed at the palace, and offered him his own house. The Minister of War came up and congratulated him on the Maria Theresa Order of the third grade, which the Emperor was conferring on him. The Empress&amp;rsquo; chamberlain invited him to see Her Majesty. The archduchess also wished to see him. He did not know whom to answer, and for a few seconds collected his thoughts. Then the Russian ambassador took him by the shoulder, led him to the window, and began to talk to him.</p>
    <p>Contrary to Bilíbin&amp;rsquo;s forecast the news he had brought was joyfully received. A thanksgiving service was arranged, Kutúzov was awarded the Grand Cross of Maria Theresa, and the whole army received rewards. Bolkónski was invited everywhere, and had to spend the whole morning calling on the principal Austrian dignitaries. Between four and five in the afternoon, having made all his calls, he was returning to Bilíbin&amp;rsquo;s house thinking out a letter to his father about the battle and his visit to Brünn. At the door he found a vehicle half full of luggage. Franz, Bilíbin&amp;rsquo;s man, was dragging a portmanteau with some difficulty out of the front door.</p>
    <p>Before returning to Bilíbin&amp;rsquo;s Prince Andrew had gone to a bookshop to provide himself with some books for the campaign, and had spent some time in the shop.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;What is it?&amp;rdquo; he asked.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Oh, your excellency!&amp;rdquo; said Franz, with difficulty rolling the portmanteau into the vehicle, &amp;ldquo;we are to move on still farther. The scoundrel is again at our heels!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Eh? What?&amp;rdquo; asked Prince Andrew.</p>
    <p>Bilíbin came out to meet him. His usually calm face showed excitement.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;There now! Confess that this is delightful,&amp;rdquo; said he. &amp;ldquo;This affair of the Thabor Bridge, at Vienna.... They have crossed without striking a blow!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Prince Andrew could not understand.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;But where do you come from not to know what every coachman in the town knows?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I come from the archduchess&amp;rsquo;. I heard nothing there.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;And you didn&amp;rsquo;t see that everybody is packing up?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I did not... What is it all about?&amp;rdquo; inquired Prince Andrew impatiently.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s it all about? Why, the French have crossed the bridge that Auersperg was defending, and the bridge was not blown up: so Murat is now rushing along the road to Brünn and will be here in a day or two.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;What? Here? But why did they not blow up the bridge, if it was mined?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;That is what I ask you. No one, not even Bonaparte, knows why.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Bolkónski shrugged his shoulders.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;But if the bridge is crossed it means that the army too is lost? It will be cut off,&amp;rdquo; said he.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s just it,&amp;rdquo; answered Bilíbin. &amp;ldquo;Listen! The French entered Vienna as I told you. Very well. Next day, which was yesterday, those gentlemen, <i>messieurs les maréchaux</i>, * Murat, Lannes, and Belliard, mount and ride to the bridge. (Observe that all three are Gascons.) &amp;lsquo;Gentlemen,&amp;rsquo; says one of them, &amp;lsquo;you know the Thabor Bridge is mined and doubly mined and that there are menacing fortifications at its head and an army of fifteen thousand men has been ordered to blow up the bridge and not let us cross? But it will please our sovereign the Emperor Napoleon if we take this bridge, so let us three go and take it!&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;Yes, let&amp;rsquo;s!&amp;rsquo; say the others. And off they go and take the bridge, cross it, and now with their whole army are on this side of the Danube, marching on us, you, and your lines of communication.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <pre class="testable">* The marshalls.</pre>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Stop jesting,&amp;rdquo; said Prince Andrew sadly and seriously. This news grieved him and yet he was pleased.</p>
    <p>As soon as he learned that the Russian army was in such a hopeless situation it occurred to him that it was he who was destined to lead it out of this position; that here was the Toulon that would lift him from the ranks of obscure officers and offer him the first step to fame! Listening to Bilíbin he was already imagining how on reaching the army he would give an opinion at the war council which would be the only one that could save the army, and how he alone would be entrusted with the executing of the plan.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Stop this jesting,&amp;rdquo; he said.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I am not jesting,&amp;rdquo; Bilíbin went on. &amp;ldquo;Nothing is truer or sadder. These gentlemen ride onto the bridge alone and wave white handkerchiefs; they assure the officer on duty that they, the marshals, are on their way to negotiate with Prince Auersperg. He lets them enter the <i>tête-de-pont</i>. * They spin him a thousand gasconades, saying that the war is over, that the Emperor Francis is arranging a meeting with Bonaparte, that they desire to see Prince Auersperg, and so on. The officer sends for Auersperg; these gentlemen embrace the officers, crack jokes, sit on the cannon, and meanwhile a French battalion gets to the bridge unobserved, flings the bags of incendiary material into the water, and approaches the <i>tête-de-pont</i>. At length appears the lieutenant general, our dear Prince Auersperg von Mautern himself. &amp;lsquo;Dearest foe! Flower of the Austrian army, hero of the Turkish wars! Hostilities are ended, we can shake one another&amp;rsquo;s hand.... The Emperor Napoleon burns with impatience to make Prince Auersperg&amp;rsquo;s acquaintance.&amp;rsquo; In a word, those gentlemen, Gascons indeed, so bewildered him with fine words, and he is so flattered by his rapidly established intimacy with the French marshals, and so dazzled by the sight of Murat&amp;rsquo;s mantle and ostrich plumes, <i>qu&amp;rsquo;il n&amp;rsquo;y voit que du feu, et oublie celui qu&amp;rsquo;il devait faire faire sur l&amp;rsquo;ennemi!&amp;rdquo;</i> *(2) In spite of the animation of his speech, Bilíbin did not forget to pause after this mot to give time for its due appreciation. &amp;ldquo;The French battalion rushes to the bridgehead, spikes the guns, and the bridge is taken! But what is best of all,&amp;rdquo; he went on, his excitement subsiding under the delightful interest of his own story, &amp;ldquo;is that the sergeant in charge of the cannon which was to give the signal to fire the mines and blow up the bridge, this sergeant, seeing that the French troops were running onto the bridge, was about to fire, but Lannes stayed his hand. The sergeant, who was evidently wiser than his general, goes up to Auersperg and says: &amp;lsquo;Prince, you are being deceived, here are the French!&amp;rsquo; Murat, seeing that all is lost if the sergeant is allowed to speak, turns to Auersperg with feigned astonishment (he is a true Gascon) and says: &amp;lsquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t recognize the world-famous Austrian discipline, if you allow a subordinate to address you like that!&amp;rsquo; It was a stroke of genius. Prince Auersperg feels his dignity at stake and orders the sergeant to be arrested. Come, you must own that this affair of the Thabor Bridge is delightful! It is not exactly stupidity, nor rascality....&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <pre class="testable">* Bridgehead. * (2) That their fire gets into his eyes and he forgets that he ought to be firing at the enemy.</pre>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;It may be treachery,&amp;rdquo; said Prince Andrew, vividly imagining the gray overcoats, wounds, the smoke of gunpowder, the sounds of firing, and the glory that awaited him.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Not that either. That puts the court in too bad a light,&amp;rdquo; replied Bilíbin. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s not treachery nor rascality nor stupidity: it is just as at Ulm... it is...&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;he seemed to be trying to find the right expression. <i>&amp;ldquo;C&amp;rsquo;est... c&amp;rsquo;est du Mack. Nous sommes mackés</i> (It is... it is a bit of Mack. We are <i>Macked</i>),&amp;rdquo; he concluded, feeling that he had produced a good epigram, a fresh one that would be repeated. His hitherto puckered brow became smooth as a sign of pleasure, and with a slight smile he began to examine his nails.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Where are you off to?&amp;rdquo; he said suddenly to Prince Andrew who had risen and was going toward his room.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I am going away.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Where to?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;To the army.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;But you meant to stay another two days?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;But now I am off at once.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>And Prince Andrew after giving directions about his departure went to his room.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Do you know, <i>mon cher</i>,&amp;rdquo; said Bilíbin following him, &amp;ldquo;I have been thinking about you. Why are you going?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>And in proof of the conclusiveness of his opinion all the wrinkles vanished from his face.</p>
    <p>Prince Andrew looked inquiringly at him and gave no reply.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Why are you going? I know you think it your duty to gallop back to the army now that it is in danger. I understand that. <i>Mon cher</i>, it is heroism!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Not at all,&amp;rdquo; said Prince Andrew.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;But as you are a philosopher, be a consistent one, look at the other side of the question and you will see that your duty, on the contrary, is to take care of yourself. Leave it to those who are no longer fit for anything else.... You have not been ordered to return and have not been dismissed from here; therefore, you can stay and go with us wherever our ill luck takes us. They say we are going to Olmütz, and Olmütz is a very decent town. You and I will travel comfortably in my <i>calèche</i>.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Do stop joking, Bilíbin,&amp;rdquo; cried Bolkónski.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I am speaking sincerely as a friend! Consider! Where and why are you going, when you might remain here? You are faced by one of two things,&amp;rdquo; and the skin over his left temple puckered, &amp;ldquo;either you will not reach your regiment before peace is concluded, or you will share defeat and disgrace with Kutúzov&amp;rsquo;s whole army.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>And Bilíbin unwrinkled his temple, feeling that the dilemma was insoluble.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I cannot argue about it,&amp;rdquo; replied Prince Andrew coldly, but he thought: &amp;ldquo;I am going to save the army.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;My dear fellow, you are a hero!&amp;rdquo; said Bilíbin.</p>
    <h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
    <p>That same night, having taken leave of the Minister of War, Bolkónski set off to rejoin the army, not knowing where he would find it and fearing to be captured by the French on the way to Krems.</p>
    <p>In Brünn everybody attached to the court was packing up, and the heavy baggage was already being dispatched to Olmütz. Near Hetzelsdorf Prince Andrew struck the high road along which the Russian army was moving with great haste and in the greatest disorder. The road was so obstructed with carts that it was impossible to get by in a carriage. Prince Andrew took a horse and a Cossack from a Cossack commander, and hungry and weary, making his way past the baggage wagons, rode in search of the commander in chief and of his own luggage. Very sinister reports of the position of the army reached him as he went along, and the appearance of the troops in their disorderly flight confirmed these rumors.</p>
    <p><i>&amp;ldquo;Cette armée russe que l&amp;rsquo;or de l&amp;rsquo;Angleterre a transportée des extrémités de l&amp;rsquo;univers, nous allons lui faire éprouver le même sort&amp;mdash;(le sort de l&amp;rsquo;armée d&amp;rsquo;Ulm).&amp;rdquo;</i> * He remembered these words in Bonaparte&amp;rsquo;s address to his army at the beginning of the campaign, and they awoke in him astonishment at the genius of his hero, a feeling of wounded pride, and a hope of glory. &amp;ldquo;And should there be nothing left but to die?&amp;rdquo; he thought. &amp;ldquo;Well, if need be, I shall do it no worse than others.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <pre class="testable">* &amp;ldquo;That Russian army which has been brought from the ends of the earth by English gold, we shall cause to share the same fate&amp;mdash;(the fate of the army at Ulm).&amp;rdquo;</pre>
    <p>He looked with disdain at the endless confused mass of detachments, carts, guns, artillery, and again baggage wagons and vehicles of all kinds overtaking one another and blocking the muddy road, three and sometimes four abreast. From all sides, behind and before, as far as ear could reach, there were the rattle of wheels, the creaking of carts and gun carriages, the tramp of horses, the crack of whips, shouts, the urging of horses, and the swearing of soldiers, orderlies, and officers. All along the sides of the road fallen horses were to be seen, some flayed, some not, and broken-down carts beside which solitary soldiers sat waiting for something, and again soldiers straggling from their companies, crowds of whom set off to the neighboring villages, or returned from them dragging sheep, fowls, hay, and bulging sacks. At each ascent or descent of the road the crowds were yet denser and the din of shouting more incessant. Soldiers floundering knee-deep in mud pushed the guns and wagons themselves. Whips cracked, hoofs slipped, traces broke, and lungs were strained with shouting. The officers directing the march rode backward and forward between the carts. Their voices were but feebly heard amid the uproar and one saw by their faces that they despaired of the possibility of checking this disorder.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Here is our dear Orthodox Russian army,&amp;rdquo; thought Bolkónski, recalling Bilíbin&amp;rsquo;s words.</p>
    <p>Wishing to find out where the commander in chief was, he rode up to a convoy. Directly opposite to him came a strange one-horse vehicle, evidently rigged up by soldiers out of any available materials and looking like something between a cart, a cabriolet, and a <i>calèche</i>. A soldier was driving, and a woman enveloped in shawls sat behind the apron under the leather hood of the vehicle. Prince Andrew rode up and was just putting his question to a soldier when his attention was diverted by the desperate shrieks of the woman in the vehicle. An officer in charge of transport was beating the soldier who was driving the woman&amp;rsquo;s vehicle for trying to get ahead of others, and the strokes of his whip fell on the apron of the equipage. The woman screamed piercingly. Seeing Prince Andrew she leaned out from behind the apron and, waving her thin arms from under the woolen shawl, cried:</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Mr. Aide-de-camp! Mr. Aide-de-camp!... For heaven&amp;rsquo;s sake... Protect me! What will become of us? I am the wife of the doctor of the Seventh Chasseurs.... They won&amp;rsquo;t let us pass, we are left behind and have lost our people...&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll flatten you into a pancake!&amp;rdquo; shouted the angry officer to the soldier. &amp;ldquo;Turn back with your slut!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Mr. Aide-de-camp! Help me!... What does it all mean?&amp;rdquo; screamed the doctor&amp;rsquo;s wife.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Kindly let this cart pass. Don&amp;rsquo;t you see it&amp;rsquo;s a woman?&amp;rdquo; said Prince Andrew riding up to the officer.</p>
    <p>The officer glanced at him, and without replying turned again to the soldier. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll teach you to push on!... Back!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Let them pass, I tell you!&amp;rdquo; repeated Prince Andrew, compressing his lips.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;And who are you?&amp;rdquo; cried the officer, turning on him with tipsy rage, &amp;ldquo;who are <i>you?</i> Are you in command here? Eh? I am commander here, not you! Go back or I&amp;rsquo;ll flatten you into a pancake,&amp;rdquo; repeated he. This expression evidently pleased him.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;That was a nice snub for the little aide-de-camp,&amp;rdquo; came a voice from behind.</p>
    <p>Prince Andrew saw that the officer was in that state of senseless, tipsy rage when a man does not know what he is saying. He saw that his championship of the doctor&amp;rsquo;s wife in her queer trap might expose him to what he dreaded more than anything in the world&amp;mdash;to ridicule; but his instinct urged him on. Before the officer finished his sentence Prince Andrew, his face distorted with fury, rode up to him and raised his riding whip.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Kind...ly let&amp;mdash;them&amp;mdash;pass!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The officer flourished his arm and hastily rode away.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s all the fault of these fellows on the staff that there&amp;rsquo;s this disorder,&amp;rdquo; he muttered. &amp;ldquo;Do as you like.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Prince Andrew without lifting his eyes rode hastily away from the doctor&amp;rsquo;s wife, who was calling him her deliverer, and recalling with a sense of disgust the minutest details of this humiliating scene he galloped on to the village where he was told that the commander in chief was.</p>
    <p>On reaching the village he dismounted and went to the nearest house, intending to rest if but for a moment, eat something, and try to sort out the stinging and tormenting thoughts that confused his mind. &amp;ldquo;This is a mob of scoundrels and not an army,&amp;rdquo; he was thinking as he went up to the window of the first house, when a familiar voice called him by name.</p>
    <p>He turned round. Nesvítski&amp;rsquo;s handsome face looked out of the little window. Nesvítski, moving his moist lips as he chewed something, and flourishing his arm, called him to enter.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Bolkónski! Bolkónski!... Don&amp;rsquo;t you hear? Eh? Come quick...&amp;rdquo; he shouted.</p>
    <p>Entering the house, Prince Andrew saw Nesvítski and another adjutant having something to eat. They hastily turned round to him asking if he had any news. On their familiar faces he read agitation and alarm. This was particularly noticeable on Nesvítski&amp;rsquo;s usually laughing countenance.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Where is the commander in chief?&amp;rdquo; asked Bolkónski.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Here, in that house,&amp;rdquo; answered the adjutant.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well, is it true that it&amp;rsquo;s peace and capitulation?&amp;rdquo; asked Nesvítski.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I was going to ask you. I know nothing except that it was all I could do to get here.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;And we, my dear boy! It&amp;rsquo;s terrible! I was wrong to laugh at Mack, we&amp;rsquo;re getting it still worse,&amp;rdquo; said Nesvítski. &amp;ldquo;But sit down and have something to eat.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;You won&amp;rsquo;t be able to find either your baggage or anything else now, Prince. And God only knows where your man Peter is,&amp;rdquo; said the other adjutant.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Where are headquarters?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;We are to spend the night in Znaim.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well, I have got all I need into packs for two horses,&amp;rdquo; said Nesvítski. &amp;ldquo;They&amp;rsquo;ve made up splendid packs for me&amp;mdash;fit to cross the Bohemian mountains with. It&amp;rsquo;s a bad lookout, old fellow! But what&amp;rsquo;s the matter with you? You must be ill to shiver like that,&amp;rdquo; he added, noticing that Prince Andrew winced as at an electric shock.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s nothing,&amp;rdquo; replied Prince Andrew.</p>
    <p>He had just remembered his recent encounter with the doctor&amp;rsquo;s wife and the convoy officer.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;What is the commander in chief doing here?&amp;rdquo; he asked.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I can&amp;rsquo;t make out at all,&amp;rdquo; said Nesvítski.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well, all I can make out is that everything is abominable, abominable, quite abominable!&amp;rdquo; said Prince Andrew, and he went off to the house where the commander in chief was.</p>
    <p>Passing by Kutúzov&amp;rsquo;s carriage and the exhausted saddle horses of his suite, with their Cossacks who were talking loudly together, Prince Andrew entered the passage. Kutúzov himself, he was told, was in the house with Prince Bagratión and Weyrother. Weyrother was the Austrian general who had succeeded Schmidt. In the passage little Kozlóvski was squatting on his heels in front of a clerk. The clerk, with cuffs turned up, was hastily writing at a tub turned bottom upwards. Kozlóvski&amp;rsquo;s face looked worn&amp;mdash;he too had evidently not slept all night. He glanced at Prince Andrew and did not even nod to him.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Second line... have you written it?&amp;rdquo; he continued dictating to the clerk. &amp;ldquo;The Kiev Grenadiers, Podolian...&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;One can&amp;rsquo;t write so fast, your honor,&amp;rdquo; said the clerk, glancing angrily and disrespectfully at Kozlóvski.</p>
    <p>Through the door came the sounds of Kutúzov&amp;rsquo;s voice, excited and dissatisfied, interrupted by another, an unfamiliar voice. From the sound of these voices, the inattentive way Kozlóvski looked at him, the disrespectful manner of the exhausted clerk, the fact that the clerk and Kozlóvski were squatting on the floor by a tub so near to the commander in chief, and from the noisy laughter of the Cossacks holding the horses near the window, Prince Andrew felt that something important and disastrous was about to happen.</p>
    <p>He turned to Kozlóvski with urgent questions.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Immediately, Prince,&amp;rdquo; said Kozlóvski. &amp;ldquo;Dispositions for Bagratión.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;What about capitulation?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Nothing of the sort. Orders are issued for a battle.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Prince Andrew moved toward the door from whence voices were heard. Just as he was going to open it the sounds ceased, the door opened, and Kutúzov with his eagle nose and puffy face appeared in the doorway. Prince Andrew stood right in front of Kutúzov but the expression of the commander in chief&amp;rsquo;s one sound eye showed him to be so preoccupied with thoughts and anxieties as to be oblivious of his presence. He looked straight at his adjutant&amp;rsquo;s face without recognizing him.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well, have you finished?&amp;rdquo; said he to Kozlóvski.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;One moment, your excellency.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Bagratión, a gaunt middle-aged man of medium height with a firm, impassive face of Oriental type, came out after the commander in chief.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I have the honor to present myself,&amp;rdquo; repeated Prince Andrew rather loudly, handing Kutúzov an envelope.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Ah, from Vienna? Very good. Later, later!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Kutúzov went out into the porch with Bagratión.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well, good-by, Prince,&amp;rdquo; said he to Bagratión. &amp;ldquo;My blessing, and may Christ be with you in your great endeavor!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>His face suddenly softened and tears came into his eyes. With his left hand he drew Bagratión toward him, and with his right, on which he wore a ring, he made the sign of the cross over him with a gesture evidently habitual, offering his puffy cheek, but Bagratión kissed him on the neck instead.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Christ be with you!&amp;rdquo; Kutúzov repeated and went toward his carriage. &amp;ldquo;Get in with me,&amp;rdquo; said he to Bolkónski.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Your excellency, I should like to be of use here. Allow me to remain with Prince Bagratión&amp;rsquo;s detachment.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Get in,&amp;rdquo; said Kutúzov, and noticing that Bolkónski still delayed, he added: &amp;ldquo;I need good officers myself, need them myself!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>They got into the carriage and drove for a few minutes in silence.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;There is still much, much before us,&amp;rdquo; he said, as if with an old man&amp;rsquo;s penetration he understood all that was passing in Bolkónski&amp;rsquo;s mind. &amp;ldquo;If a tenth part of his detachment returns I shall thank God,&amp;rdquo; he added as if speaking to himself.</p>
    <p>Prince Andrew glanced at Kutúzov&amp;rsquo;s face only a foot distant from him and involuntarily noticed the carefully washed seams of the scar near his temple, where an Ismail bullet had pierced his skull, and the empty eye socket. &amp;ldquo;Yes, he has a right to speak so calmly of those men&amp;rsquo;s death,&amp;rdquo; thought Bolkónski.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;That is why I beg to be sent to that detachment,&amp;rdquo; he said.</p>
    <p>Kutúzov did not reply. He seemed to have forgotten what he had been saying, and sat plunged in thought. Five minutes later, gently swaying on the soft springs of the carriage, he turned to Prince Andrew. There was not a trace of agitation on his face. With delicate irony he questioned Prince Andrew about the details of his interview with the Emperor, about the remarks he had heard at court concerning the Krems affair, and about some ladies they both knew.</p>
    <h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
    <p>On November 1 Kutúzov had received, through a spy, news that the army he commanded was in an almost hopeless position. The spy reported that the French, after crossing the bridge at Vienna, were advancing in immense force upon Kutúzov&amp;rsquo;s line of communication with the troops that were arriving from Russia. If Kutúzov decided to remain at Krems, Napoleon&amp;rsquo;s army of one hundred and fifty thousand men would cut him off completely and surround his exhausted army of forty thousand, and he would find himself in the position of Mack at Ulm. If Kutúzov decided to abandon the road connecting him with the troops arriving from Russia, he would have to march with no road into unknown parts of the Bohemian mountains, defending himself against superior forces of the enemy and abandoning all hope of a junction with Buxhöwden. If Kutúzov decided to retreat along the road from Krems to Olmütz, to unite with the troops arriving from Russia, he risked being forestalled on that road by the French who had crossed the Vienna bridge, and encumbered by his baggage and transport, having to accept battle on the march against an enemy three times as strong, who would hem him in from two sides.</p>
    <p>Kutúzov chose this latter course.</p>
    <p>The French, the spy reported, having crossed the Vienna bridge, were advancing by forced marches toward Znaim, which lay sixty-six miles off on the line of Kutúzov&amp;rsquo;s retreat. If he reached Znaim before the French, there would be great hope of saving the army; to let the French forestall him at Znaim meant the exposure of his whole army to a disgrace such as that of Ulm, or to utter destruction. But to forestall the French with his whole army was impossible. The road for the French from Vienna to Znaim was shorter and better than the road for the Russians from Krems to Znaim.</p>
    <p>The night he received the news, Kutúzov sent Bagratión&amp;rsquo;s vanguard, four thousand strong, to the right across the hills from the Krems-Znaim to the Vienna-Znaim road. Bagratión was to make this march without resting, and to halt facing Vienna with Znaim to his rear, and if he succeeded in forestalling the French he was to delay them as long as possible. Kutúzov himself with all his transport took the road to Znaim.</p>
    <p>Marching thirty miles that stormy night across roadless hills, with his hungry, ill-shod soldiers, and losing a third of his men as stragglers by the way, Bagratión came out on the Vienna-Znaim road at Hollabrünn a few hours ahead of the French who were approaching Hollabrünn from Vienna. Kutúzov with his transport had still to march for some days before he could reach Znaim. Hence Bagratión with his four thousand hungry, exhausted men would have to detain for days the whole enemy army that came upon him at Hollabrünn, which was clearly impossible. But a freak of fate made the impossible possible. The success of the trick that had placed the Vienna bridge in the hands of the French without a fight led Murat to try to deceive Kutúzov in a similar way. Meeting Bagratión&amp;rsquo;s weak detachment on the Znaim road he supposed it to be Kutúzov&amp;rsquo;s whole army. To be able to crush it absolutely he awaited the arrival of the rest of the troops who were on their way from Vienna, and with this object offered a three days&amp;rsquo; truce on condition that both armies should remain in position without moving. Murat declared that negotiations for peace were already proceeding, and that he therefore offered this truce to avoid unnecessary bloodshed. Count Nostitz, the Austrian general occupying the advanced posts, believed Murat&amp;rsquo;s emissary and retired, leaving Bagratión&amp;rsquo;s division exposed. Another emissary rode to the Russian line to announce the peace negotiations and to offer the Russian army the three days&amp;rsquo; truce. Bagratión replied that he was not authorized either to accept or refuse a truce and sent his adjutant to Kutúzov to report the offer he had received.</p>
    <p>A truce was Kutúzov&amp;rsquo;s sole chance of gaining time, giving Bagratión&amp;rsquo;s exhausted troops some rest, and letting the transport and heavy convoys (whose movements were concealed from the French) advance if but one stage nearer Znaim. The offer of a truce gave the only, and a quite unexpected, chance of saving the army. On receiving the news he immediately dispatched Adjutant General Wintzingerode, who was in attendance on him, to the enemy camp. Wintzingerode was not merely to agree to the truce but also to offer terms of capitulation, and meanwhile Kutúzov sent his adjutants back to hasten to the utmost the movements of the baggage trains of the entire army along the Krems-Znaim road. Bagratión&amp;rsquo;s exhausted and hungry detachment, which alone covered this movement of the transport and of the whole army, had to remain stationary in face of an enemy eight times as strong as itself.</p>
    <p>Kutúzov&amp;rsquo;s expectations that the proposals of capitulation (which were in no way binding) might give time for part of the transport to pass, and also that Murat&amp;rsquo;s mistake would very soon be discovered, proved correct. As soon as Bonaparte (who was at Schönbrunn, sixteen miles from Hollabrünn) received Murat&amp;rsquo;s dispatch with the proposal of a truce and a capitulation, he detected a ruse and wrote the following letter to Murat:</p>
    <p>Schönbrunn, 25th Brumaire, 1805,</p>
    <p>at eight o&amp;rsquo;clock in the morning</p>
    <p>To PRINCE MURAT,</p>
    <p>I cannot find words to express to you my displeasure. You command only my advance guard, and have no right to arrange an armistice without my order. You are causing me to lose the fruits of a campaign. Break the armistice immediately and march on the enemy. Inform him that the general who signed that capitulation had no right to do so, and that no one but the Emperor of Russia has that right.</p>
    <p>If, however, the Emperor of Russia ratifies that convention, I will ratify it; but it is only a trick. March on, destroy the Russian army.... You are in a position to seize its baggage and artillery.</p>
    <p>The Russian Emperor&amp;rsquo;s aide-de-camp is an impostor. Officers are nothing when they have no powers; this one had none.... The Austrians let themselves be tricked at the crossing of the Vienna bridge, you are letting yourself be tricked by an aide-de-camp of the Emperor.</p>
    <p>NAPOLEON</p>
    <p>Bonaparte&amp;rsquo;s adjutant rode full gallop with this menacing letter to Murat. Bonaparte himself, not trusting to his generals, moved with all the Guards to the field of battle, afraid of letting a ready victim escape, and Bagratión&amp;rsquo;s four thousand men merrily lighted campfires, dried and warmed themselves, cooked their porridge for the first time for three days, and not one of them knew or imagined what was in store for him.</p>
    <h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
    <p>Between three and four o&amp;rsquo;clock in the afternoon Prince Andrew, who had persisted in his request to Kutúzov, arrived at Grunth and reported himself to Bagratión. Bonaparte&amp;rsquo;s adjutant had not yet reached Murat&amp;rsquo;s detachment and the battle had not yet begun. In Bagratión&amp;rsquo;s detachment no one knew anything of the general position of affairs. They talked of peace but did not believe in its possibility; others talked of a battle but also disbelieved in the nearness of an engagement. Bagratión, knowing Bolkónski to be a favorite and trusted adjutant, received him with distinction and special marks of favor, explaining to him that there would probably be an engagement that day or the next, and giving him full liberty to remain with him during the battle or to join the rearguard and have an eye on the order of retreat, &amp;ldquo;which is also very important.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;However, there will hardly be an engagement today,&amp;rdquo; said Bagratión as if to reassure Prince Andrew.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;If he is one of the ordinary little staff dandies sent to earn a medal he can get his reward just as well in the rearguard, but if he wishes to stay with me, let him... he&amp;rsquo;ll be of use here if he&amp;rsquo;s a brave officer,&amp;rdquo; thought Bagratión. Prince Andrew, without replying, asked the prince&amp;rsquo;s permission to ride round the position to see the disposition of the forces, so as to know his bearings should he be sent to execute an order. The officer on duty, a handsome, elegantly dressed man with a diamond ring on his forefinger, who was fond of speaking French though he spoke it badly, offered to conduct Prince Andrew.</p>
    <p>On all sides they saw rain-soaked officers with dejected faces who seemed to be seeking something, and soldiers dragging doors, benches, and fencing from the village.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;There now, Prince! We can&amp;rsquo;t stop those fellows,&amp;rdquo; said the staff officer pointing to the soldiers. &amp;ldquo;The officers don&amp;rsquo;t keep them in hand. And there,&amp;rdquo; he pointed to a sutler&amp;rsquo;s tent, &amp;ldquo;they crowd in and sit. This morning I turned them all out and now look, it&amp;rsquo;s full again. I must go there, Prince, and scare them a bit. It won&amp;rsquo;t take a moment.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Yes, let&amp;rsquo;s go in and I will get myself a roll and some cheese,&amp;rdquo; said Prince Andrew who had not yet had time to eat anything.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Why didn&amp;rsquo;t you mention it, Prince? I would have offered you something.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>They dismounted and entered the tent. Several officers, with flushed and weary faces, were sitting at the table eating and drinking.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Now what does this mean, gentlemen?&amp;rdquo; said the staff officer, in the reproachful tone of a man who has repeated the same thing more than once. &amp;ldquo;You know it won&amp;rsquo;t do to leave your posts like this. The prince gave orders that no one should leave his post. Now you, Captain,&amp;rdquo; and he turned to a thin, dirty little artillery officer who without his boots (he had given them to the canteen keeper to dry), in only his stockings, rose when they entered, smiling not altogether comfortably.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well, aren&amp;rsquo;t you ashamed of yourself, Captain Túshin?&amp;rdquo; he continued. &amp;ldquo;One would think that as an artillery officer you would set a good example, yet here you are without your boots! The alarm will be sounded and you&amp;rsquo;ll be in a pretty position without your boots!&amp;rdquo; (The staff officer smiled.) &amp;ldquo;Kindly return to your posts, gentlemen, all of you, all!&amp;rdquo; he added in a tone of command.</p>
    <p>Prince Andrew smiled involuntarily as he looked at the artillery officer Túshin, who silent and smiling, shifting from one stockinged foot to the other, glanced inquiringly with his large, intelligent, kindly eyes from Prince Andrew to the staff officer.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;The soldiers say it feels easier without boots,&amp;rdquo; said Captain Túshin smiling shyly in his uncomfortable position, evidently wishing to adopt a jocular tone. But before he had finished he felt that his jest was unacceptable and had not come off. He grew confused.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Kindly return to your posts,&amp;rdquo; said the staff officer trying to preserve his gravity.</p>
    <p>Prince Andrew glanced again at the artillery officer&amp;rsquo;s small figure. There was something peculiar about it, quite unsoldierly, rather comic, but extremely attractive.</p>
    <p>The staff officer and Prince Andrew mounted their horses and rode on.</p>
    <p>Having ridden beyond the village, continually meeting and overtaking soldiers and officers of various regiments, they saw on their left some entrenchments being thrown up, the freshly dug clay of which showed up red. Several battalions of soldiers, in their shirt sleeves despite the cold wind, swarmed in these earthworks like a host of white ants; spadefuls of red clay were continually being thrown up from behind the bank by unseen hands. Prince Andrew and the officer rode up, looked at the entrenchment, and went on again. Just behind it they came upon some dozens of soldiers, continually replaced by others, who ran from the entrenchment. They had to hold their noses and put their horses to a trot to escape from the poisoned atmosphere of these latrines.</p>
    <p><i>&amp;ldquo;Voilà l&amp;rsquo;agrément des camps, monsieur le prince,&amp;rdquo;</i> * said the staff officer.</p>
    <pre class="testable">* &amp;ldquo;This is a pleasure one gets in camp, Prince.&amp;rdquo;</pre>
    <p>They rode up the opposite hill. From there the French could already be seen. Prince Andrew stopped and began examining the position.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s our battery,&amp;rdquo; said the staff officer indicating the highest point. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s in charge of the queer fellow we saw without his boots. You can see everything from there; let&amp;rsquo;s go there, Prince.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Thank you very much, I will go on alone,&amp;rdquo; said Prince Andrew, wishing to rid himself of this staff officer&amp;rsquo;s company, &amp;ldquo;please don&amp;rsquo;t trouble yourself further.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The staff officer remained behind and Prince Andrew rode on alone.</p>
    <p>The farther forward and nearer the enemy he went, the more orderly and cheerful were the troops. The greatest disorder and depression had been in the baggage train he had passed that morning on the Znaim road seven miles away from the French. At Grunth also some apprehension and alarm could be felt, but the nearer Prince Andrew came to the French lines the more confident was the appearance of our troops. The soldiers in their greatcoats were ranged in lines, the sergeants major and company officers were counting the men, poking the last man in each section in the ribs and telling him to hold his hand up. Soldiers scattered over the whole place were dragging logs and brushwood and were building shelters with merry chatter and laughter; around the fires sat others, dressed and undressed, drying their shirts and leg bands or mending boots or overcoats and crowding round the boilers and porridge cookers. In one company dinner was ready, and the soldiers were gazing eagerly at the steaming boiler, waiting till the sample, which a quartermaster sergeant was carrying in a wooden bowl to an officer who sat on a log before his shelter, had been tasted.</p>
    <p>Another company, a lucky one for not all the companies had vodka, crowded round a pockmarked, broad-shouldered sergeant major who, tilting a keg, filled one after another the canteen lids held out to him. The soldiers lifted the canteen lids to their lips with reverential faces, emptied them, rolling the vodka in their mouths, and walked away from the sergeant major with brightened expressions, licking their lips and wiping them on the sleeves of their greatcoats. All their faces were as serene as if all this were happening at home awaiting peaceful encampment, and not within sight of the enemy before an action in which at least half of them would be left on the field. After passing a chasseur regiment and in the lines of the Kiev grenadiers&amp;mdash;fine fellows busy with similar peaceful affairs&amp;mdash;near the shelter of the regimental commander, higher than and different from the others, Prince Andrew came out in front of a platoon of grenadiers before whom lay a naked man. Two soldiers held him while two others were flourishing their switches and striking him regularly on his bare back. The man shrieked unnaturally. A stout major was pacing up and down the line, and regardless of the screams kept repeating:</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s a shame for a soldier to steal; a soldier must be honest, honorable, and brave, but if he robs his fellows there is no honor in him, he&amp;rsquo;s a scoundrel. Go on! Go on!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>So the swishing sound of the strokes, and the desperate but unnatural screams, continued.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Go on, go on!&amp;rdquo; said the major.</p>
    <p>A young officer with a bewildered and pained expression on his face stepped away from the man and looked round inquiringly at the adjutant as he rode by.</p>
    <p>Prince Andrew, having reached the front line, rode along it. Our front line and that of the enemy were far apart on the right and left flanks, but in the center where the men with a flag of truce had passed that morning, the lines were so near together that the men could see one another&amp;rsquo;s faces and speak to one another. Besides the soldiers who formed the picket line on either side, there were many curious onlookers who, jesting and laughing, stared at their strange foreign enemies.</p>
    <p>Since early morning&amp;mdash;despite an injunction not to approach the picket line&amp;mdash;the officers had been unable to keep sight-seers away. The soldiers forming the picket line, like showmen exhibiting a curiosity, no longer looked at the French but paid attention to the sight-seers and grew weary waiting to be relieved. Prince Andrew halted to have a look at the French.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Look! Look there!&amp;rdquo; one soldier was saying to another, pointing to a Russian musketeer who had gone up to the picket line with an officer and was rapidly and excitedly talking to a French grenadier. &amp;ldquo;Hark to him jabbering! Fine, isn&amp;rsquo;t it? It&amp;rsquo;s all the Frenchy can do to keep up with him. There now, Sídorov!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Wait a bit and listen. It&amp;rsquo;s fine!&amp;rdquo; answered Sídorov, who was considered an adept at French.</p>
    <p>The soldier to whom the laughers referred was Dólokhov. Prince Andrew recognized him and stopped to listen to what he was saying. Dólokhov had come from the left flank where their regiment was stationed, with his captain.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Now then, go on, go on!&amp;rdquo; incited the officer, bending forward and trying not to lose a word of the speech which was incomprehensible to him. &amp;ldquo;More, please: more! What&amp;rsquo;s he saying?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Dólokhov did not answer the captain; he had been drawn into a hot dispute with the French grenadier. They were naturally talking about the campaign. The Frenchman, confusing the Austrians with the Russians, was trying to prove that the Russians had surrendered and had fled all the way from Ulm, while Dólokhov maintained that the Russians had not surrendered but had beaten the French.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;We have orders to drive you off here, and we shall drive you off,&amp;rdquo; said Dólokhov.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Only take care you and your Cossacks are not all captured!&amp;rdquo; said the French grenadier.</p>
    <p>The French onlookers and listeners laughed.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ll make you dance as we did under Suvórov...,&amp;rdquo; * said Dólokhov.</p>
    <pre class="testable">* <i>&amp;ldquo;On vous fera danser.&amp;rdquo;</i></pre>
    <p><i>&amp;ldquo;Qu&amp;rsquo; est-ce qu&amp;rsquo;il chante?&amp;rdquo;</i> * asked a Frenchman.</p>
    <pre class="testable">* &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s he singing about?&amp;rdquo;</pre>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s ancient history,&amp;rdquo; said another, guessing that it referred to a former war. &amp;ldquo;The Emperor will teach your Suvara as he has taught the others...&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Bonaparte...&amp;rdquo; began Dólokhov, but the Frenchman interrupted him.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Not Bonaparte. He is the Emperor! <i>Sacré nom...!&amp;rdquo;</i> cried he angrily.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;The devil skin your Emperor.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>And Dólokhov swore at him in coarse soldier&amp;rsquo;s Russian and shouldering his musket walked away.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Let us go, Iván Lukích,&amp;rdquo; he said to the captain.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Ah, that&amp;rsquo;s the way to talk French,&amp;rdquo; said the picket soldiers. &amp;ldquo;Now, Sídorov, you have a try!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Sídorov, turning to the French, winked, and began to jabber meaningless sounds very fast: <i>&amp;ldquo;Kari, mala, tafa, safi, muter, Kaská,&amp;rdquo;</i> he said, trying to give an expressive intonation to his voice.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Ho! ho! ho! Ha! ha! ha! ha! Ouh! ouh!&amp;rdquo; came peals of such healthy and good-humored laughter from the soldiers that it infected the French involuntarily, so much so that the only thing left to do seemed to be to unload the muskets, explode the ammunition, and all return home as quickly as possible.</p>
    <p>But the guns remained loaded, the loopholes in blockhouses and entrenchments looked out just as menacingly, and the unlimbered cannon confronted one another as before.</p>
    <h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
    <p>Having ridden round the whole line from right flank to left, Prince Andrew made his way up to the battery from which the staff officer had told him the whole field could be seen. Here he dismounted, and stopped beside the farthest of the four unlimbered cannon. Before the guns an artillery sentry was pacing up and down; he stood at attention when the officer arrived, but at a sign resumed his measured, monotonous pacing. Behind the guns were their limbers and still farther back picket ropes and artillerymen&amp;rsquo;s bonfires. To the left, not far from the farthest cannon, was a small, newly constructed wattle shed from which came the sound of officers&amp;rsquo; voices in eager conversation.</p>
    <p>It was true that a view over nearly the whole Russian position and the greater part of the enemy&amp;rsquo;s opened out from this battery. Just facing it, on the crest of the opposite hill, the village of Schön Grabern could be seen, and in three places to left and right the French troops amid the smoke of their campfires, the greater part of whom were evidently in the village itself and behind the hill. To the left from that village, amid the smoke, was something resembling a battery, but it was impossible to see it clearly with the naked eye. Our right flank was posted on a rather steep incline which dominated the French position. Our infantry were stationed there, and at the farthest point the dragoons. In the center, where Túshin&amp;rsquo;s battery stood and from which Prince Andrew was surveying the position, was the easiest and most direct descent and ascent to the brook separating us from Schön Grabern. On the left our troops were close to a copse, in which smoked the bonfires of our infantry who were felling wood. The French line was wider than ours, and it was plain that they could easily outflank us on both sides. Behind our position was a steep and deep dip, making it difficult for artillery and cavalry to retire. Prince Andrew took out his notebook and, leaning on the cannon, sketched a plan of the position. He made some notes on two points, intending to mention them to Bagratión. His idea was, first, to concentrate all the artillery in the center, and secondly, to withdraw the cavalry to the other side of the dip. Prince Andrew, being always near the commander in chief, closely following the mass movements and general orders, and constantly studying historical accounts of battles, involuntarily pictured to himself the course of events in the forthcoming action in broad outline. He imagined only important possibilities: &amp;ldquo;If the enemy attacks the right flank,&amp;rdquo; he said to himself, &amp;ldquo;the Kiev grenadiers and the Podólsk chasseurs must hold their position till reserves from the center come up. In that case the dragoons could successfully make a flank counterattack. If they attack our center we, having the center battery on this high ground, shall withdraw the left flank under its cover, and retreat to the dip by echelons.&amp;rdquo; So he reasoned.... All the time he had been beside the gun, he had heard the voices of the officers distinctly, but as often happens had not understood a word of what they were saying. Suddenly, however, he was struck by a voice coming from the shed, and its tone was so sincere that he could not but listen.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;No, friend,&amp;rdquo; said a pleasant and, as it seemed to Prince Andrew, a familiar voice, &amp;ldquo;what I say is that if it were possible to know what is beyond death, none of us would be afraid of it. That&amp;rsquo;s so, friend.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Another, a younger voice, interrupted him: &amp;ldquo;Afraid or not, you can&amp;rsquo;t escape it anyhow.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;All the same, one is afraid! Oh, you clever people,&amp;rdquo; said a third manly voice interrupting them both. &amp;ldquo;Of course you artillery men are very wise, because you can take everything along with you&amp;mdash;vodka and snacks.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>And the owner of the manly voice, evidently an infantry officer, laughed.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Yes, one is afraid,&amp;rdquo; continued the first speaker, he of the familiar voice. &amp;ldquo;One is afraid of the unknown, that&amp;rsquo;s what it is. Whatever we may say about the soul going to the sky... we know there is no sky but only an atmosphere.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The manly voice again interrupted the artillery officer.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well, stand us some of your herb vodka, Túshin,&amp;rdquo; it said.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Why,&amp;rdquo; thought Prince Andrew, &amp;ldquo;that&amp;rsquo;s the captain who stood up in the sutler&amp;rsquo;s hut without his boots.&amp;rdquo; He recognized the agreeable, philosophizing voice with pleasure.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Some herb vodka? Certainly!&amp;rdquo; said Túshin. &amp;ldquo;But still, to conceive a future life...&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>He did not finish. Just then there was a whistle in the air; nearer and nearer, faster and louder, louder and faster, a cannon ball, as if it had not finished saying what was necessary, thudded into the ground near the shed with super human force, throwing up a mass of earth. The ground seemed to groan at the terrible impact.</p>
    <p>And immediately Túshin, with a short pipe in the corner of his mouth and his kind, intelligent face rather pale, rushed out of the shed followed by the owner of the manly voice, a dashing infantry officer who hurried off to his company, buttoning up his coat as he ran.</p>
    <h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
    <p>Mounting his horse again Prince Andrew lingered with the battery, looking at the puff from the gun that had sent the ball. His eyes ran rapidly over the wide space, but he only saw that the hitherto motionless masses of the French now swayed and that there really was a battery to their left. The smoke above it had not yet dispersed. Two mounted Frenchmen, probably adjutants, were galloping up the hill. A small but distinctly visible enemy column was moving down the hill, probably to strengthen the front line. The smoke of the first shot had not yet dispersed before another puff appeared, followed by a report. The battle had begun! Prince Andrew turned his horse and galloped back to Grunth to find Prince Bagratión. He heard the cannonade behind him growing louder and more frequent. Evidently our guns had begun to reply. From the bottom of the slope, where the parleys had taken place, came the report of musketry.</p>
    <p>Lemarrois had just arrived at a gallop with Bonaparte&amp;rsquo;s stern letter, and Murat, humiliated and anxious to expiate his fault, had at once moved his forces to attack the center and outflank both the Russian wings, hoping before evening and before the arrival of the Emperor to crush the contemptible detachment that stood before him.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;It has begun. Here it is!&amp;rdquo; thought Prince Andrew, feeling the blood rush to his heart. &amp;ldquo;But where and how will my Toulon present itself?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Passing between the companies that had been eating porridge and drinking vodka a quarter of an hour before, he saw everywhere the same rapid movement of soldiers forming ranks and getting their muskets ready, and on all their faces he recognized the same eagerness that filled his heart. &amp;ldquo;It has begun! Here it is, dreadful but enjoyable!&amp;rdquo; was what the face of each soldier and each officer seemed to say.</p>
    <p>Before he had reached the embankments that were being thrown up, he saw, in the light of the dull autumn evening, mounted men coming toward him. The foremost, wearing a Cossack cloak and lambskin cap and riding a white horse, was Prince Bagratión. Prince Andrew stopped, waiting for him to come up; Prince Bagratión reined in his horse and recognizing Prince Andrew nodded to him. He still looked ahead while Prince Andrew told him what he had seen.</p>
    <p>The feeling, &amp;ldquo;It has begun! Here it is!&amp;rdquo; was seen even on Prince Bagratión&amp;rsquo;s hard brown face with its half-closed, dull, sleepy eyes. Prince Andrew gazed with anxious curiosity at that impassive face and wished he could tell what, if anything, this man was thinking and feeling at that moment. &amp;ldquo;Is there anything at all behind that impassive face?&amp;rdquo; Prince Andrew asked himself as he looked. Prince Bagratión bent his head in sign of agreement with what Prince Andrew told him, and said, &amp;ldquo;Very good!&amp;rdquo; in a tone that seemed to imply that everything that took place and was reported to him was exactly what he had foreseen. Prince Andrew, out of breath with his rapid ride, spoke quickly. Prince Bagratión, uttering his words with an Oriental accent, spoke particularly slowly, as if to impress the fact that there was no need to hurry. However, he put his horse to a trot in the direction of Túshin&amp;rsquo;s battery. Prince Andrew followed with the suite. Behind Prince Bagratión rode an officer of the suite, the prince&amp;rsquo;s personal adjutant, Zherkóv, an orderly officer, the staff officer on duty, riding a fine bobtailed horse, and a civilian&amp;mdash;an accountant who had asked permission to be present at the battle out of curiosity. The accountant, a stout, full-faced man, looked around him with a naïve smile of satisfaction and presented a strange appearance among the hussars, Cossacks, and adjutants, in his camlet coat, as he jolted on his horse with a convoy officer&amp;rsquo;s saddle.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;He wants to see a battle,&amp;rdquo; said Zherkóv to Bolkónski, pointing to the accountant, &amp;ldquo;but he feels a pain in the pit of his stomach already.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Oh, leave off!&amp;rdquo; said the accountant with a beaming but rather cunning smile, as if flattered at being made the subject of Zherkóv&amp;rsquo;s joke, and purposely trying to appear stupider than he really was.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;It is very strange, <i>mon Monsieur Prince</i>,&amp;rdquo; said the staff officer. (He remembered that in French there is some peculiar way of addressing a prince, but could not get it quite right.)</p>
    <p>By this time they were all approaching Túshin&amp;rsquo;s battery, and a ball struck the ground in front of them.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s that that has fallen?&amp;rdquo; asked the accountant with a naïve smile.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;A French pancake,&amp;rdquo; answered Zherkóv.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;So that&amp;rsquo;s what they hit with?&amp;rdquo; asked the accountant. &amp;ldquo;How awful!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>He seemed to swell with satisfaction. He had hardly finished speaking when they again heard an unexpectedly violent whistling which suddenly ended with a thud into something soft... <i>f-f-flop!</i> and a Cossack, riding a little to their right and behind the accountant, crashed to earth with his horse. Zherkóv and the staff officer bent over their saddles and turned their horses away. The accountant stopped, facing the Cossack, and examined him with attentive curiosity. The Cossack was dead, but the horse still struggled.</p>
    <p>Prince Bagratión screwed up his eyes, looked round, and, seeing the cause of the confusion, turned away with indifference, as if to say, &amp;ldquo;Is it worth while noticing trifles?&amp;rdquo; He reined in his horse with the care of a skillful rider and, slightly bending over, disengaged his saber which had caught in his cloak. It was an old-fashioned saber of a kind no longer in general use. Prince Andrew remembered the story of Suvórov giving his saber to Bagratión in Italy, and the recollection was particularly pleasant at that moment. They had reached the battery at which Prince Andrew had been when he examined the battlefield.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Whose company?&amp;rdquo; asked Prince Bagratión of an artilleryman standing by the ammunition wagon.</p>
    <p>He asked, &amp;ldquo;Whose company?&amp;rdquo; but he really meant, &amp;ldquo;Are you frightened here?&amp;rdquo; and the artilleryman understood him.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Captain Túshin&amp;rsquo;s, your excellency!&amp;rdquo; shouted the red-haired, freckled gunner in a merry voice, standing to attention.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Yes, yes,&amp;rdquo; muttered Bagratión as if considering something, and he rode past the limbers to the farthest cannon.</p>
    <p>As he approached, a ringing shot issued from it deafening him and his suite, and in the smoke that suddenly surrounded the gun they could see the gunners who had seized it straining to roll it quickly back to its former position. A huge, broad-shouldered gunner, Number One, holding a mop, his legs far apart, sprang to the wheel; while Number Two with a trembling hand placed a charge in the cannon&amp;rsquo;s mouth. The short, round-shouldered Captain Túshin, stumbling over the tail of the gun carriage, moved forward and, not noticing the general, looked out shading his eyes with his small hand.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Lift it two lines more and it will be just right,&amp;rdquo; cried he in a feeble voice to which he tried to impart a dashing note, ill-suited to his weak figure. &amp;ldquo;Number Two!&amp;rdquo; he squeaked. &amp;ldquo;Fire, Medvédev!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Bagratión called to him, and Túshin, raising three fingers to his cap with a bashful and awkward gesture not at all like a military salute but like a priest&amp;rsquo;s benediction, approached the general. Though Túshin&amp;rsquo;s guns had been intended to cannonade the valley, he was firing incendiary balls at the village of Schön Grabern visible just opposite, in front of which large masses of French were advancing.</p>
    <p>No one had given Túshin orders where and at what to fire, but after consulting his sergeant major, Zakharchénko, for whom he had great respect, he had decided that it would be a good thing to set fire to the village. &amp;ldquo;Very good!&amp;rdquo; said Bagratión in reply to the officer&amp;rsquo;s report, and began deliberately to examine the whole battlefield extended before him. The French had advanced nearest on our right. Below the height on which the Kiev regiment was stationed, in the hollow where the rivulet flowed, the soul-stirring rolling and crackling of musketry was heard, and much farther to the right beyond the dragoons, the officer of the suite pointed out to Bagratión a French column that was outflanking us. To the left the horizon bounded by the adjacent wood. Prince Bagratión ordered two battalions from the center to be sent to reinforce the right flank. The officer of the suite ventured to remark to the prince that if these battalions went away, the guns would remain without support. Prince Bagratión turned to the officer and with his dull eyes looked at him in silence. It seemed to Prince Andrew that the officer&amp;rsquo;s remark was just and that really no answer could be made to it. But at that moment an adjutant galloped up with a message from the commander of the regiment in the hollow and news that immense masses of the French were coming down upon them and that his regiment was in disorder and was retreating upon the Kiev grenadiers. Prince Bagratión bowed his head in sign of assent and approval. He rode off at a walk to the right and sent an adjutant to the dragoons with orders to attack the French. But this adjutant returned half an hour later with the news that the commander of the dragoons had already retreated beyond the dip in the ground, as a heavy fire had been opened on him and he was losing men uselessly, and so had hastened to throw some sharpshooters into the wood.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Very good!&amp;rdquo; said Bagratión.</p>
    <p>As he was leaving the battery, firing was heard on the left also, and as it was too far to the left flank for him to have time to go there himself, Prince Bagratión sent Zherkóv to tell the general in command (the one who had paraded his regiment before Kutúzov at Braunau) that he must retreat as quickly as possible behind the hollow in the rear, as the right flank would probably not be able to withstand the enemy&amp;rsquo;s attack very long. About Túshin and the battalion that had been in support of his battery all was forgotten. Prince Andrew listened attentively to Bagratión&amp;rsquo;s colloquies with the commanding officers and the orders he gave them and, to his surprise, found that no orders were really given, but that Prince Bagratión tried to make it appear that everything done by necessity, by accident, or by the will of subordinate commanders was done, if not by his direct command, at least in accord with his intentions. Prince Andrew noticed, however, that though what happened was due to chance and was independent of the commander&amp;rsquo;s will, owing to the tact Bagratión showed, his presence was very valuable. Officers who approached him with disturbed countenances became calm; soldiers and officers greeted him gaily, grew more cheerful in his presence, and were evidently anxious to display their courage before him.</p>
    <h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
    <p>Prince Bagratión, having reached the highest point of our right flank, began riding downhill to where the roll of musketry was heard but where on account of the smoke nothing could be seen. The nearer they got to the hollow the less they could see but the more they felt the nearness of the actual battlefield. They began to meet wounded men. One with a bleeding head and no cap was being dragged along by two soldiers who supported him under the arms. There was a gurgle in his throat and he was spitting blood. A bullet had evidently hit him in the throat or mouth. Another was walking sturdily by himself but without his musket, groaning aloud and swinging his arm which had just been hurt, while blood from it was streaming over his greatcoat as from a bottle. He had that moment been wounded and his face showed fear rather than suffering. Crossing a road they descended a steep incline and saw several men lying on the ground; they also met a crowd of soldiers some of whom were unwounded. The soldiers were ascending the hill breathing heavily, and despite the general&amp;rsquo;s presence were talking loudly and gesticulating. In front of them rows of gray cloaks were already visible through the smoke, and an officer catching sight of Bagratión rushed shouting after the crowd of retreating soldiers, ordering them back. Bagratión rode up to the ranks along which shots crackled now here and now there, drowning the sound of voices and the shouts of command. The whole air reeked with smoke. The excited faces of the soldiers were blackened with it. Some were using their ramrods, others putting powder on the touchpans or taking charges from their pouches, while others were firing, though who they were firing at could not be seen for the smoke which there was no wind to carry away. A pleasant humming and whistling of bullets were often heard. &amp;ldquo;What is this?&amp;rdquo; thought Prince Andrew approaching the crowd of soldiers. &amp;ldquo;It can&amp;rsquo;t be an attack, for they are not moving; it can&amp;rsquo;t be a square&amp;mdash;for they are not drawn up for that.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The commander of the regiment, a thin, feeble-looking old man with a pleasant smile&amp;mdash;his eyelids drooping more than half over his old eyes, giving him a mild expression, rode up to Bagratión and welcomed him as a host welcomes an honored guest. He reported that his regiment had been attacked by French cavalry and that, though the attack had been repulsed, he had lost more than half his men. He said the attack had been repulsed, employing this military term to describe what had occurred to his regiment, but in reality he did not himself know what had happened during that half-hour to the troops entrusted to him, and could not say with certainty whether the attack had been repulsed or his regiment had been broken up. All he knew was that at the commencement of the action balls and shells began flying all over his regiment and hitting men and that afterwards someone had shouted &amp;ldquo;Cavalry!&amp;rdquo; and our men had begun firing. They were still firing, not at the cavalry which had disappeared, but at French infantry who had come into the hollow and were firing at our men. Prince Bagratión bowed his head as a sign that this was exactly what he had desired and expected. Turning to his adjutant he ordered him to bring down the two battalions of the Sixth Chasseurs whom they had just passed. Prince Andrew was struck by the changed expression on Prince Bagratión&amp;rsquo;s face at this moment. It expressed the concentrated and happy resolution you see on the face of a man who on a hot day takes a final run before plunging into the water. The dull, sleepy expression was no longer there, nor the affectation of profound thought. The round, steady, hawk&amp;rsquo;s eyes looked before him eagerly and rather disdainfully, not resting on anything although his movements were still slow and measured.</p>
    <p>The commander of the regiment turned to Prince Bagratión, entreating him to go back as it was too dangerous to remain where they were. &amp;ldquo;Please, your excellency, for God&amp;rsquo;s sake!&amp;rdquo; he kept saying, glancing for support at an officer of the suite who turned away from him. &amp;ldquo;There, you see!&amp;rdquo; and he drew attention to the bullets whistling, singing, and hissing continually around them. He spoke in the tone of entreaty and reproach that a carpenter uses to a gentleman who has picked up an ax: &amp;ldquo;We are used to it, but you, sir, will blister your hands.&amp;rdquo; He spoke as if those bullets could not kill him, and his half-closed eyes gave still more persuasiveness to his words. The staff officer joined in the colonel&amp;rsquo;s appeals, but Bagratión did not reply; he only gave an order to cease firing and re-form, so as to give room for the two approaching battalions. While he was speaking, the curtain of smoke that had concealed the hollow, driven by a rising wind, began to move from right to left as if drawn by an invisible hand, and the hill opposite, with the French moving about on it, opened out before them. All eyes fastened involuntarily on this French column advancing against them and winding down over the uneven ground. One could already see the soldiers&amp;rsquo; shaggy caps, distinguish the officers from the men, and see the standard flapping against its staff.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;They march splendidly,&amp;rdquo; remarked someone in Bagratión&amp;rsquo;s suite.</p>
    <p>The head of the column had already descended into the hollow. The clash would take place on this side of it...</p>
    <p>The remains of our regiment which had been in action rapidly formed up and moved to the right; from behind it, dispersing the laggards, came two battalions of the Sixth Chasseurs in fine order. Before they had reached Bagratión, the weighty tread of the mass of men marching in step could be heard. On their left flank, nearest to Bagratión, marched a company commander, a fine round-faced man, with a stupid and happy expression&amp;mdash;the same man who had rushed out of the wattle shed. At that moment he was clearly thinking of nothing but how dashing a fellow he would appear as he passed the commander.</p>
    <p>With the self-satisfaction of a man on parade, he stepped lightly with his muscular legs as if sailing along, stretching himself to his full height without the smallest effort, his ease contrasting with the heavy tread of the soldiers who were keeping step with him. He carried close to his leg a narrow unsheathed sword (small, curved, and not like a real weapon) and looked now at the superior officers and now back at the men without losing step, his whole powerful body turning flexibly. It was as if all the powers of his soul were concentrated on passing the commander in the best possible manner, and feeling that he was doing it well he was happy. &amp;ldquo;Left... left... left...&amp;rdquo; he seemed to repeat to himself at each alternate step; and in time to this, with stern but varied faces, the wall of soldiers burdened with knapsacks and muskets marched in step, and each one of these hundreds of soldiers seemed to be repeating to himself at each alternate step, &amp;ldquo;Left... left... left...&amp;rdquo; A fat major skirted a bush, puffing and falling out of step; a soldier who had fallen behind, his face showing alarm at his defection, ran at a trot, panting to catch up with his company. A cannon ball, cleaving the air, flew over the heads of Bagratión and his suite, and fell into the column to the measure of <i>&amp;ldquo;Left... left!&amp;rdquo;</i> &amp;ldquo;Close up!&amp;rdquo; came the company commander&amp;rsquo;s voice in jaunty tones. The soldiers passed in a semicircle round something where the ball had fallen, and an old trooper on the flank, a noncommissioned officer who had stopped beside the dead men, ran to catch up his line and, falling into step with a hop, looked back angrily, and through the ominous silence and the regular tramp of feet beating the ground in unison, one seemed to hear <i>left... left... left.</i></p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well done, lads!&amp;rdquo; said Prince Bagratión.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Glad to do our best, your ex&amp;rsquo;len-lency!&amp;rdquo; came a confused shout from the ranks. A morose soldier marching on the left turned his eyes on Bagratión as he shouted, with an expression that seemed to say: &amp;ldquo;We know that ourselves!&amp;rdquo; Another, without looking round, as though fearing to relax, shouted with his mouth wide open and passed on.</p>
    <p>The order was given to halt and down knapsacks.</p>
    <p>Bagratión rode round the ranks that had marched past him and dismounted. He gave the reins to a Cossack, took off and handed over his felt coat, stretched his legs, and set his cap straight. The head of the French column, with its officers leading, appeared from below the hill.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Forward, with God!&amp;rdquo; said Bagratión, in a resolute, sonorous voice, turning for a moment to the front line, and slightly swinging his arms, he went forward uneasily over the rough field with the awkward gait of a cavalryman. Prince Andrew felt that an invisible power was leading him forward, and experienced great happiness.</p>
    <p>The French were already near. Prince Andrew, walking beside Bagratión, could clearly distinguish their bandoliers, red epaulets, and even their faces. (He distinctly saw an old French officer who, with gaitered legs and turned-out toes, climbed the hill with difficulty.) Prince Bagratión gave no further orders and silently continued to walk on in front of the ranks. Suddenly one shot after another rang out from the French, smoke appeared all along their uneven ranks, and musket shots sounded. Several of our men fell, among them the round-faced officer who had marched so gaily and complacently. But at the moment the first report was heard, Bagratión looked round and shouted, &amp;ldquo;Hurrah!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Hurrah&amp;mdash;ah!&amp;mdash;ah!&amp;rdquo; rang a long-drawn shout from our ranks, and passing Bagratión and racing one another they rushed in an irregular but joyous and eager crowd down the hill at their disordered foe.</p>
    <h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
    <p>The attack of the Sixth Chasseurs secured the retreat of our right flank. In the center Túshin&amp;rsquo;s forgotten battery, which had managed to set fire to the Schön Grabern village, delayed the French advance. The French were putting out the fire which the wind was spreading, and thus gave us time to retreat. The retirement of the center to the other side of the dip in the ground at the rear was hurried and noisy, but the different companies did not get mixed. But our left&amp;mdash;which consisted of the Azóv and Podólsk infantry and the Pávlograd hussars&amp;mdash;was simultaneously attacked and outflanked by superior French forces under Lannes and was thrown into confusion. Bagratión had sent Zherkóv to the general commanding that left flank with orders to retreat immediately.</p>
    <p>Zherkóv, not removing his hand from his cap, turned his horse about and galloped off. But no sooner had he left Bagratión than his courage failed him. He was seized by panic and could not go where it was dangerous.</p>
    <p>Having reached the left flank, instead of going to the front where the firing was, he began to look for the general and his staff where they could not possibly be, and so did not deliver the order.</p>
    <p>The command of the left flank belonged by seniority to the commander of the regiment Kutúzov had reviewed at Braunau and in which Dólokhov was serving as a private. But the command of the extreme left flank had been assigned to the commander of the Pávlograd regiment in which Rostóv was serving, and a misunderstanding arose. The two commanders were much exasperated with one another and, long after the action had begun on the right flank and the French were already advancing, were engaged in discussion with the sole object of offending one another. But the regiments, both cavalry and infantry, were by no means ready for the impending action. From privates to general they were not expecting a battle and were engaged in peaceful occupations, the cavalry feeding the horses and the infantry collecting wood.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;He higher iss dan I in rank,&amp;rdquo; said the German colonel of the hussars, flushing and addressing an adjutant who had ridden up, &amp;ldquo;so let him do what he vill, but I cannot sacrifice my hussars... Bugler, sount ze retreat!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>But haste was becoming imperative. Cannon and musketry, mingling together, thundered on the right and in the center, while the capotes of Lannes&amp;rsquo; sharpshooters were already seen crossing the milldam and forming up within twice the range of a musket shot. The general in command of the infantry went toward his horse with jerky steps, and having mounted drew himself up very straight and tall and rode to the Pávlograd commander. The commanders met with polite bows but with secret malevolence in their hearts.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Once again, Colonel,&amp;rdquo; said the general, &amp;ldquo;I can&amp;rsquo;t leave half my men in the wood. I <i>beg</i> of you, I <i>beg</i> of you,&amp;rdquo; he repeated, &amp;ldquo;to occupy the <i>position</i> and prepare for an attack.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I peg of you yourself not to mix in vot is not your business!&amp;rdquo; suddenly replied the irate colonel. &amp;ldquo;If you vere in the cavalry...&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I am not in the cavalry, Colonel, but I am a Russian general and if you are not aware of the fact...&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Quite avare, your excellency,&amp;rdquo; suddenly shouted the colonel, touching his horse and turning purple in the face. &amp;ldquo;Vill you be so goot to come to ze front and see dat zis position iss no goot? I don&amp;rsquo;t vish to destroy my men for your pleasure!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;You forget yourself, Colonel. I am not considering my own pleasure and I won&amp;rsquo;t allow it to be said!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Taking the colonel&amp;rsquo;s outburst as a challenge to his courage, the general expanded his chest and rode, frowning, beside him to the front line, as if their differences would be settled there amongst the bullets. They reached the front, several bullets sped over them, and they halted in silence. There was nothing fresh to be seen from the line, for from where they had been before it had been evident that it was impossible for cavalry to act among the bushes and broken ground, as well as that the French were outflanking our left. The general and colonel looked sternly and significantly at one another like two fighting cocks preparing for battle, each vainly trying to detect signs of cowardice in the other. Both passed the examination successfully. As there was nothing to be said, and neither wished to give occasion for it to be alleged that he had been the first to leave the range of fire, they would have remained there for a long time testing each other&amp;rsquo;s courage had it not been that just then they heard the rattle of musketry and a muffled shout almost behind them in the wood. The French had attacked the men collecting wood in the copse. It was no longer possible for the hussars to retreat with the infantry. They were cut off from the line of retreat on the left by the French. However inconvenient the position, it was now necessary to attack in order to cut a way through for themselves.</p>
    <p>The squadron in which Rostóv was serving had scarcely time to mount before it was halted facing the enemy. Again, as at the Enns bridge, there was nothing between the squadron and the enemy, and again that terrible dividing line of uncertainty and fear&amp;mdash;resembling the line separating the living from the dead&amp;mdash;lay between them. All were conscious of this unseen line, and the question whether they would cross it or not, and how they would cross it, agitated them all.</p>
    <p>The colonel rode to the front, angrily gave some reply to questions put to him by the officers, and, like a man desperately insisting on having his own way, gave an order. No one said anything definite, but the rumor of an attack spread through the squadron. The command to form up rang out and the sabers whizzed as they were drawn from their scabbards. Still no one moved. The troops of the left flank, infantry and hussars alike, felt that the commander did not himself know what to do, and this irresolution communicated itself to the men.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;If only they would be quick!&amp;rdquo; thought Rostóv, feeling that at last the time had come to experience the joy of an attack of which he had so often heard from his fellow hussars.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Fo&amp;rsquo;ward, with God, lads!&amp;rdquo; rang out Denísov&amp;rsquo;s voice. &amp;ldquo;At a twot fo&amp;rsquo;ward!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The horses&amp;rsquo; croups began to sway in the front line. Rook pulled at the reins and started of his own accord.</p>
    <p>Before him, on the right, Rostóv saw the front lines of his hussars and still farther ahead a dark line which he could not see distinctly but took to be the enemy. Shots could be heard, but some way off.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Faster!&amp;rdquo; came the word of command, and Rostóv felt Rook&amp;rsquo;s flanks drooping as he broke into a gallop.</p>
    <p>Rostóv anticipated his horse&amp;rsquo;s movements and became more and more elated. He had noticed a solitary tree ahead of him. This tree had been in the middle of the line that had seemed so terrible&amp;mdash;and now he had crossed that line and not only was there nothing terrible, but everything was becoming more and more happy and animated. &amp;ldquo;Oh, how I will slash at him!&amp;rdquo; thought Rostóv, gripping the hilt of his saber.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Hur-a-a-a-ah!&amp;rdquo; came a roar of voices. &amp;ldquo;Let anyone come my way now,&amp;rdquo; thought Rostóv driving his spurs into Rook and letting him go at a full gallop so that he outstripped the others. Ahead, the enemy was already visible. Suddenly something like a birch broom seemed to sweep over the squadron. Rostóv raised his saber, ready to strike, but at that instant the trooper Nikítenko, who was galloping ahead, shot away from him, and Rostóv felt as in a dream that he continued to be carried forward with unnatural speed but yet stayed on the same spot. From behind him Bondarchúk, an hussar he knew, jolted against him and looked angrily at him. Bondarchúk&amp;rsquo;s horse swerved and galloped past.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;How is it I am not moving? I have fallen, I am killed!&amp;rdquo; Rostóv asked and answered at the same instant. He was alone in the middle of a field. Instead of the moving horses and hussars&amp;rsquo; backs, he saw nothing before him but the motionless earth and the stubble around him. There was warm blood under his arm. &amp;ldquo;No, I am wounded and the horse is killed.&amp;rdquo; Rook tried to rise on his forelegs but fell back, pinning his rider&amp;rsquo;s leg. Blood was flowing from his head; he struggled but could not rise. Rostóv also tried to rise but fell back, his sabretache having become entangled in the saddle. Where our men were, and where the French, he did not know. There was no one near.</p>
    <p>Having disentangled his leg, he rose. &amp;ldquo;Where, on which side, was now the line that had so sharply divided the two armies?&amp;rdquo; he asked himself and could not answer. &amp;ldquo;Can something bad have happened to me?&amp;rdquo; he wondered as he got up: and at that moment he felt that something superfluous was hanging on his benumbed left arm. The wrist felt as if it were not his. He examined his hand carefully, vainly trying to find blood on it. &amp;ldquo;Ah, here are people coming,&amp;rdquo; he thought joyfully, seeing some men running toward him. &amp;ldquo;They will help me!&amp;rdquo; In front came a man wearing a strange shako and a blue cloak, swarthy, sunburned, and with a hooked nose. Then came two more, and many more running behind. One of them said something strange, not in Russian. In among the hindmost of these men wearing similar shakos was a Russian hussar. He was being held by the arms and his horse was being led behind him.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;It must be one of ours, a prisoner. Yes. Can it be that they will take me too? Who are these men?&amp;rdquo; thought Rostóv, scarcely believing his eyes. &amp;ldquo;Can they be French?&amp;rdquo; He looked at the approaching Frenchmen, and though but a moment before he had been galloping to get at them and hack them to pieces, their proximity now seemed so awful that he could not believe his eyes. &amp;ldquo;Who are they? Why are they running? Can they be coming at me? And why? To kill me? <i>Me</i> whom everyone is so fond of?&amp;rdquo; He remembered his mother&amp;rsquo;s love for him, and his family&amp;rsquo;s, and his friends&amp;rsquo;, and the enemy&amp;rsquo;s intention to kill him seemed impossible. &amp;ldquo;But perhaps they may do it!&amp;rdquo; For more than ten seconds he stood not moving from the spot or realizing the situation. The foremost Frenchman, the one with the hooked nose, was already so close that the expression of his face could be seen. And the excited, alien face of that man, his bayonet hanging down, holding his breath, and running so lightly, frightened Rostóv. He seized his pistol and, instead of firing it, flung it at the Frenchman and ran with all his might toward the bushes. He did not now run with the feeling of doubt and conflict with which he had trodden the Enns bridge, but with the feeling of a hare fleeing from the hounds. One single sentiment, that of fear for his young and happy life, possessed his whole being. Rapidly leaping the furrows, he fled across the field with the impetuosity he used to show at catchplay, now and then turning his good-natured, pale, young face to look back. A shudder of terror went through him: &amp;ldquo;No, better not look,&amp;rdquo; he thought, but having reached the bushes he glanced round once more. The French had fallen behind, and just as he looked round the first man changed his run to a walk and, turning, shouted something loudly to a comrade farther back. Rostóv paused. &amp;ldquo;No, there&amp;rsquo;s some mistake,&amp;rdquo; thought he. &amp;ldquo;They can&amp;rsquo;t have wanted to kill me.&amp;rdquo; But at the same time, his left arm felt as heavy as if a seventy-pound weight were tied to it. He could run no more. The Frenchman also stopped and took aim. Rostóv closed his eyes and stooped down. One bullet and then another whistled past him. He mustered his last remaining strength, took hold of his left hand with his right, and reached the bushes. Behind these were some Russian sharpshooters.</p>
    <h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
    <p>The infantry regiments that had been caught unawares in the outskirts of the wood ran out of it, the different companies getting mixed, and retreated as a disorderly crowd. One soldier, in his fear, uttered the senseless cry, &amp;ldquo;Cut off!&amp;rdquo; that is so terrible in battle, and that word infected the whole crowd with a feeling of panic.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Surrounded! Cut off? We&amp;rsquo;re lost!&amp;rdquo; shouted the fugitives.</p>
    <p>The moment he heard the firing and the cry from behind, the general realized that something dreadful had happened to his regiment, and the thought that he, an exemplary officer of many years&amp;rsquo; service who had never been to blame, might be held responsible at headquarters for negligence or inefficiency so staggered him that, forgetting the recalcitrant cavalry colonel, his own dignity as a general, and above all quite forgetting the danger and all regard for self-preservation, he clutched the crupper of his saddle and, spurring his horse, galloped to the regiment under a hail of bullets which fell around, but fortunately missed him. His one desire was to know what was happening and at any cost correct, or remedy, the mistake if he had made one, so that he, an exemplary officer of twenty-two years&amp;rsquo; service, who had never been censured, should not be held to blame.</p>
    <p>Having galloped safely through the French, he reached a field behind the copse across which our men, regardless of orders, were running and descending the valley. That moment of moral hesitation which decides the fate of battles had arrived. Would this disorderly crowd of soldiers attend to the voice of their commander, or would they, disregarding him, continue their flight? Despite his desperate shouts that used to seem so terrible to the soldiers, despite his furious purple countenance distorted out of all likeness to his former self, and the flourishing of his saber, the soldiers all continued to run, talking, firing into the air, and disobeying orders. The moral hesitation which decided the fate of battles was evidently culminating in a panic.</p>
    <p>The general had a fit of coughing as a result of shouting and of the powder smoke and stopped in despair. Everything seemed lost. But at that moment the French who were attacking, suddenly and without any apparent reason, ran back and disappeared from the outskirts, and Russian sharpshooters showed themselves in the copse. It was Timókhin&amp;rsquo;s company, which alone had maintained its order in the wood and, having lain in ambush in a ditch, now attacked the French unexpectedly. Timókhin, armed only with a sword, had rushed at the enemy with such a desperate cry and such mad, drunken determination that, taken by surprise, the French had thrown down their muskets and run. Dólokhov, running beside Timókhin, killed a Frenchman at close quarters and was the first to seize the surrendering French officer by his collar. Our fugitives returned, the battalions re-formed, and the French who had nearly cut our left flank in half were for the moment repulsed. Our reserve units were able to join up, and the fight was at an end. The regimental commander and Major Ekonómov had stopped beside a bridge, letting the retreating companies pass by them, when a soldier came up and took hold of the commander&amp;rsquo;s stirrup, almost leaning against him. The man was wearing a bluish coat of broadcloth, he had no knapsack or cap, his head was bandaged, and over his shoulder a French munition pouch was slung. He had an officer&amp;rsquo;s sword in his hand. The soldier was pale, his blue eyes looked impudently into the commander&amp;rsquo;s face, and his lips were smiling. Though the commander was occupied in giving instructions to Major Ekonómov, he could not help taking notice of the soldier.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Your excellency, here are two trophies,&amp;rdquo; said Dólokhov, pointing to the French sword and pouch. &amp;ldquo;I have taken an officer prisoner. I stopped the company.&amp;rdquo; Dólokhov breathed heavily from weariness and spoke in abrupt sentences. &amp;ldquo;The whole company can bear witness. I beg you will remember this, your excellency!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;All right, all right,&amp;rdquo; replied the commander, and turned to Major Ekonómov.</p>
    <p>But Dólokhov did not go away; he untied the handkerchief around his head, pulled it off, and showed the blood congealed on his hair.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;A bayonet wound. I remained at the front. Remember, your excellency!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Túshin&amp;rsquo;s battery had been forgotten and only at the very end of the action did Prince Bagratión, still hearing the cannonade in the center, send his orderly staff officer, and later Prince Andrew also, to order the battery to retire as quickly as possible. When the supports attached to Túshin&amp;rsquo;s battery had been moved away in the middle of the action by someone&amp;rsquo;s order, the battery had continued firing and was only not captured by the French because the enemy could not surmise that anyone could have the effrontery to continue firing from four quite undefended guns. On the contrary, the energetic action of that battery led the French to suppose that here&amp;mdash;in the center&amp;mdash;the main Russian forces were concentrated. Twice they had attempted to attack this point, but on each occasion had been driven back by grapeshot from the four isolated guns on the hillock.</p>
    <p>Soon after Prince Bagratión had left him, Túshin had succeeded in setting fire to Schön Grabern.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Look at them scurrying! It&amp;rsquo;s burning! Just see the smoke! Fine! Grand! Look at the smoke, the smoke!&amp;rdquo; exclaimed the artillerymen, brightening up.</p>
    <p>All the guns, without waiting for orders, were being fired in the direction of the conflagration. As if urging each other on, the soldiers cried at each shot: &amp;ldquo;Fine! That&amp;rsquo;s good! Look at it... Grand!&amp;rdquo; The fire, fanned by the breeze, was rapidly spreading. The French columns that had advanced beyond the village went back; but as though in revenge for this failure, the enemy placed ten guns to the right of the village and began firing them at Túshin&amp;rsquo;s battery.</p>
    <p>In their childlike glee, aroused by the fire and their luck in successfully cannonading the French, our artillerymen only noticed this battery when two balls, and then four more, fell among our guns, one knocking over two horses and another tearing off a munition-wagon driver&amp;rsquo;s leg. Their spirits once roused were, however, not diminished, but only changed character. The horses were replaced by others from a reserve gun carriage, the wounded were carried away, and the four guns were turned against the ten-gun battery. Túshin&amp;rsquo;s companion officer had been killed at the beginning of the engagement and within an hour seventeen of the forty men of the guns&amp;rsquo; crews had been disabled, but the artillerymen were still as merry and lively as ever. Twice they noticed the French appearing below them, and then they fired grapeshot at them.</p>
    <p>Little Túshin, moving feebly and awkwardly, kept telling his orderly to &amp;ldquo;refill my pipe for that one!&amp;rdquo; and then, scattering sparks from it, ran forward shading his eyes with his small hand to look at the French.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Smack at &amp;lsquo;em, lads!&amp;rdquo; he kept saying, seizing the guns by the wheels and working the screws himself.</p>
    <p>Amid the smoke, deafened by the incessant reports which always made him jump, Túshin not taking his pipe from his mouth ran from gun to gun, now aiming, now counting the charges, now giving orders about replacing dead or wounded horses and harnessing fresh ones, and shouting in his feeble voice, so high pitched and irresolute. His face grew more and more animated. Only when a man was killed or wounded did he frown and turn away from the sight, shouting angrily at the men who, as is always the case, hesitated about lifting the injured or dead. The soldiers, for the most part handsome fellows and, as is always the case in an artillery company, a head and shoulders taller and twice as broad as their officer&amp;mdash;all looked at their commander like children in an embarrassing situation, and the expression on his face was invariably reflected on theirs.</p>
    <p>Owing to the terrible uproar and the necessity for concentration and activity, Túshin did not experience the slightest unpleasant sense of fear, and the thought that he might be killed or badly wounded never occurred to him. On the contrary, he became more and more elated. It seemed to him that it was a very long time ago, almost a day, since he had first seen the enemy and fired the first shot, and that the corner of the field he stood on was well-known and familiar ground. Though he thought of everything, considered everything, and did everything the best of officers could do in his position, he was in a state akin to feverish delirium or drunkenness.</p>
    <p>From the deafening sounds of his own guns around him, the whistle and thud of the enemy&amp;rsquo;s cannon balls, from the flushed and perspiring faces of the crew bustling round the guns, from the sight of the blood of men and horses, from the little puffs of smoke on the enemy&amp;rsquo;s side (always followed by a ball flying past and striking the earth, a man, a gun, a horse), from the sight of all these things a fantastic world of his own had taken possession of his brain and at that moment afforded him pleasure. The enemy&amp;rsquo;s guns were in his fancy not guns but pipes from which occasional puffs were blown by an invisible smoker.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;There... he&amp;rsquo;s puffing again,&amp;rdquo; muttered Túshin to himself, as a small cloud rose from the hill and was borne in a streak to the left by the wind.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Now look out for the ball... we&amp;rsquo;ll throw it back.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;What do you want, your honor?&amp;rdquo; asked an artilleryman, standing close by, who heard him muttering.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Nothing... only a shell...&amp;rdquo; he answered.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Come along, our Matvévna!&amp;rdquo; he said to himself. &amp;ldquo;Matvévna&amp;rdquo; * was the name his fancy gave to the farthest gun of the battery, which was large and of an old pattern. The French swarming round their guns seemed to him like ants. In that world, the handsome drunkard Number One of the second gun&amp;rsquo;s crew was &amp;ldquo;uncle&amp;rdquo;; Túshin looked at him more often than at anyone else and took delight in his every movement. The sound of musketry at the foot of the hill, now diminishing, now increasing, seemed like someone&amp;rsquo;s breathing. He listened intently to the ebb and flow of these sounds.</p>
    <pre class="testable">* Daughter of Matthew.</pre>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Ah! Breathing again, breathing!&amp;rdquo; he muttered to himself.</p>
    <p>He imagined himself as an enormously tall, powerful man who was throwing cannon balls at the French with both hands.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Now then, Matvévna, dear old lady, don&amp;rsquo;t let me down!&amp;rdquo; he was saying as he moved from the gun, when a strange, unfamiliar voice called above his head: &amp;ldquo;Captain Túshin! Captain!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Túshin turned round in dismay. It was the staff officer who had turned him out of the booth at Grunth. He was shouting in a gasping voice:</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Are you mad? You have twice been ordered to retreat, and you...&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Why are they down on me?&amp;rdquo; thought Túshin, looking in alarm at his superior.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I... don&amp;rsquo;t...&amp;rdquo; he muttered, holding up two fingers to his cap. &amp;ldquo;I...&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>But the staff officer did not finish what he wanted to say. A cannon ball, flying close to him, caused him to duck and bend over his horse. He paused, and just as he was about to say something more, another ball stopped him. He turned his horse and galloped off.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Retire! All to retire!&amp;rdquo; he shouted from a distance.</p>
    <p>The soldiers laughed. A moment later, an adjutant arrived with the same order.</p>
    <p>It was Prince Andrew. The first thing he saw on riding up to the space where Túshin&amp;rsquo;s guns were stationed was an unharnessed horse with a broken leg, that lay screaming piteously beside the harnessed horses. Blood was gushing from its leg as from a spring. Among the limbers lay several dead men. One ball after another passed over as he approached and he felt a nervous shudder run down his spine. But the mere thought of being afraid roused him again. &amp;ldquo;I cannot be afraid,&amp;rdquo; thought he, and dismounted slowly among the guns. He delivered the order and did not leave the battery. He decided to have the guns removed from their positions and withdrawn in his presence. Together with Túshin, stepping across the bodies and under a terrible fire from the French, he attended to the removal of the guns.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;A staff officer was here a minute ago, but skipped off,&amp;rdquo; said an artilleryman to Prince Andrew. &amp;ldquo;Not like your honor!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Prince Andrew said nothing to Túshin. They were both so busy as to seem not to notice one another. When having limbered up the only two cannon that remained uninjured out of the four, they began moving down the hill (one shattered gun and one unicorn were left behind), Prince Andrew rode up to Túshin.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well, till we meet again...&amp;rdquo; he said, holding out his hand to Túshin.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Good-by, my dear fellow,&amp;rdquo; said Túshin. &amp;ldquo;Dear soul! Good-by, my dear fellow!&amp;rdquo; and for some unknown reason tears suddenly filled his eyes.</p>
    <h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
    <p>The wind had fallen and black clouds, merging with the powder smoke, hung low over the field of battle on the horizon. It was growing dark and the glow of two conflagrations was the more conspicuous. The cannonade was dying down, but the rattle of musketry behind and on the right sounded oftener and nearer. As soon as Túshin with his guns, continually driving round or coming upon wounded men, was out of range of fire and had descended into the dip, he was met by some of the staff, among them the staff officer and Zherkóv, who had been twice sent to Túshin&amp;rsquo;s battery but had never reached it. Interrupting one another, they all gave, and transmitted, orders as to how to proceed, reprimanding and reproaching him. Túshin gave no orders, and, silently&amp;mdash;fearing to speak because at every word he felt ready to weep without knowing why&amp;mdash;rode behind on his artillery nag. Though the orders were to abandon the wounded, many of them dragged themselves after troops and begged for seats on the gun carriages. The jaunty infantry officer who just before the battle had rushed out of Túshin&amp;rsquo;s wattle shed was laid, with a bullet in his stomach, on &amp;ldquo;Matvévna&amp;rsquo;s&amp;rdquo; carriage. At the foot of the hill, a pale hussar cadet, supporting one hand with the other, came up to Túshin and asked for a seat.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Captain, for God&amp;rsquo;s sake! I&amp;rsquo;ve hurt my arm,&amp;rdquo; he said timidly. &amp;ldquo;For God&amp;rsquo;s sake... I can&amp;rsquo;t walk. For God&amp;rsquo;s sake!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>It was plain that this cadet had already repeatedly asked for a lift and been refused. He asked in a hesitating, piteous voice.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Tell them to give me a seat, for God&amp;rsquo;s sake!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Give him a seat,&amp;rdquo; said Túshin. &amp;ldquo;Lay a cloak for him to sit on, lad,&amp;rdquo; he said, addressing his favorite soldier. &amp;ldquo;And where is the wounded officer?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;He has been set down. He died,&amp;rdquo; replied someone.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Help him up. Sit down, dear fellow, sit down! Spread out the cloak, Antónov.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The cadet was Rostóv. With one hand he supported the other; he was pale and his jaw trembled, shivering feverishly. He was placed on &amp;ldquo;Matvévna,&amp;rdquo; the gun from which they had removed the dead officer. The cloak they spread under him was wet with blood which stained his breeches and arm.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;What, are you wounded, my lad?&amp;rdquo; said Túshin, approaching the gun on which Rostóv sat.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;No, it&amp;rsquo;s a sprain.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Then what is this blood on the gun carriage?&amp;rdquo; inquired Túshin.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;It was the officer, your honor, stained it,&amp;rdquo; answered the artilleryman, wiping away the blood with his coat sleeve, as if apologizing for the state of his gun.</p>
    <p>It was all that they could do to get the guns up the rise aided by the infantry, and having reached the village of Gruntersdorf they halted. It had grown so dark that one could not distinguish the uniforms ten paces off, and the firing had begun to subside. Suddenly, near by on the right, shouting and firing were again heard. Flashes of shot gleamed in the darkness. This was the last French attack and was met by soldiers who had sheltered in the village houses. They all rushed out of the village again, but Túshin&amp;rsquo;s guns could not move, and the artillerymen, Túshin, and the cadet exchanged silent glances as they awaited their fate. The firing died down and soldiers, talking eagerly, streamed out of a side street.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Not hurt, Petróv?&amp;rdquo; asked one.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ve given it &amp;lsquo;em hot, mate! They won&amp;rsquo;t make another push now,&amp;rdquo; said another.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;You couldn&amp;rsquo;t see a thing. How they shot at their own fellows! Nothing could be seen. Pitch-dark, brother! Isn&amp;rsquo;t there something to drink?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The French had been repulsed for the last time. And again and again in the complete darkness Túshin&amp;rsquo;s guns moved forward, surrounded by the humming infantry as by a frame.</p>
    <p>In the darkness, it seemed as though a gloomy unseen river was flowing always in one direction, humming with whispers and talk and the sound of hoofs and wheels. Amid the general rumble, the groans and voices of the wounded were more distinctly heard than any other sound in the darkness of the night. The gloom that enveloped the army was filled with their groans, which seemed to melt into one with the darkness of the night. After a while the moving mass became agitated, someone rode past on a white horse followed by his suite, and said something in passing: &amp;ldquo;What did he say? Where to, now? Halt, is it? Did he thank us?&amp;rdquo; came eager questions from all sides. The whole moving mass began pressing closer together and a report spread that they were ordered to halt: evidently those in front had halted. All remained where they were in the middle of the muddy road.</p>
    <p>Fires were lighted and the talk became more audible. Captain Túshin, having given orders to his company, sent a soldier to find a dressing station or a doctor for the cadet, and sat down by a bonfire the soldiers had kindled on the road. Rostóv, too, dragged himself to the fire. From pain, cold, and damp, a feverish shivering shook his whole body. Drowsiness was irresistibly mastering him, but he kept awake by an excruciating pain in his arm, for which he could find no satisfactory position. He kept closing his eyes and then again looking at the fire, which seemed to him dazzlingly red, and at the feeble, round-shouldered figure of Túshin who was sitting cross-legged like a Turk beside him. Túshin&amp;rsquo;s large, kind, intelligent eyes were fixed with sympathy and commiseration on Rostóv, who saw that Túshin with his whole heart wished to help him but could not.</p>
    <p>From all sides were heard the footsteps and talk of the infantry, who were walking, driving past, and settling down all around. The sound of voices, the tramping feet, the horses&amp;rsquo; hoofs moving in mud, the crackling of wood fires near and afar, merged into one tremulous rumble.</p>
    <p>It was no longer, as before, a dark, unseen river flowing through the gloom, but a dark sea swelling and gradually subsiding after a storm. Rostóv looked at and listened listlessly to what passed before and around him. An infantryman came to the fire, squatted on his heels, held his hands to the blaze, and turned away his face.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;You don&amp;rsquo;t mind your honor?&amp;rdquo; he asked Túshin. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve lost my company, your honor. I don&amp;rsquo;t know where... such bad luck!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>With the soldier, an infantry officer with a bandaged cheek came up to the bonfire, and addressing Túshin asked him to have the guns moved a trifle to let a wagon go past. After he had gone, two soldiers rushed to the campfire. They were quarreling and fighting desperately, each trying to snatch from the other a boot they were both holding on to.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;You picked it up?... I dare say! You&amp;rsquo;re very smart!&amp;rdquo; one of them shouted hoarsely.</p>
    <p>Then a thin, pale soldier, his neck bandaged with a bloodstained leg band, came up and in angry tones asked the artillerymen for water.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Must one die like a dog?&amp;rdquo; said he.</p>
    <p>Túshin told them to give the man some water. Then a cheerful soldier ran up, begging a little fire for the infantry.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;A nice little hot torch for the infantry! Good luck to you, fellow countrymen. Thanks for the fire&amp;mdash;we&amp;rsquo;ll return it with interest,&amp;rdquo; said he, carrying away into the darkness a glowing stick.</p>
    <p>Next came four soldiers, carrying something heavy on a cloak, and passed by the fire. One of them stumbled.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Who the devil has put the logs on the road?&amp;rdquo; snarled he.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;He&amp;rsquo;s dead&amp;mdash;why carry him?&amp;rdquo; said another.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Shut up!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>And they disappeared into the darkness with their load.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Still aching?&amp;rdquo; Túshin asked Rostóv in a whisper.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Yes.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Your honor, you&amp;rsquo;re wanted by the general. He is in the hut here,&amp;rdquo; said a gunner, coming up to Túshin.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Coming, friend.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Túshin rose and, buttoning his greatcoat and pulling it straight, walked away from the fire.</p>
    <p>Not far from the artillery campfire, in a hut that had been prepared for him, Prince Bagratión sat at dinner, talking with some commanding officers who had gathered at his quarters. The little old man with the half-closed eyes was there greedily gnawing a mutton bone, and the general who had served blamelessly for twenty-two years, flushed by a glass of vodka and the dinner; and the staff officer with the signet ring, and Zherkóv, uneasily glancing at them all, and Prince Andrew, pale, with compressed lips and feverishly glittering eyes.</p>
    <p>In a corner of the hut stood a standard captured from the French, and the accountant with the naïve face was feeling its texture, shaking his head in perplexity&amp;mdash;perhaps because the banner really interested him, perhaps because it was hard for him, hungry as he was, to look on at a dinner where there was no place for him. In the next hut there was a French colonel who had been taken prisoner by our dragoons. Our officers were flocking in to look at him. Prince Bagratión was thanking the individual commanders and inquiring into details of the action and our losses. The general whose regiment had been inspected at Braunau was informing the prince that as soon as the action began he had withdrawn from the wood, mustered the men who were woodcutting, and, allowing the French to pass him, had made a bayonet charge with two battalions and had broken up the French troops.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;When I saw, your excellency, that their first battalion was disorganized, I stopped in the road and thought: &amp;lsquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll let them come on and will meet them with the fire of the whole battalion&amp;rsquo;&amp;mdash;and that&amp;rsquo;s what I did.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The general had so wished to do this and was so sorry he had not managed to do it that it seemed to him as if it had really happened. Perhaps it might really have been so? Could one possibly make out amid all that confusion what did or did not happen?</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;By the way, your excellency, I should inform you,&amp;rdquo; he continued&amp;mdash;remembering Dólokhov&amp;rsquo;s conversation with Kutúzov and his last interview with the gentleman-ranker&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;that Private Dólokhov, who was reduced to the ranks, took a French officer prisoner in my presence and particularly distinguished himself.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I saw the Pávlograd hussars attack there, your excellency,&amp;rdquo; chimed in Zherkóv, looking uneasily around. He had not seen the hussars all that day, but had heard about them from an infantry officer. &amp;ldquo;They broke up two squares, your excellency.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Several of those present smiled at Zherkóv&amp;rsquo;s words, expecting one of his usual jokes, but noticing that what he was saying redounded to the glory of our arms and of the day&amp;rsquo;s work, they assumed a serious expression, though many of them knew that what he was saying was a lie devoid of any foundation. Prince Bagratión turned to the old colonel:</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Gentlemen, I thank you all; all arms have behaved heroically: infantry, cavalry, and artillery. How was it that two guns were abandoned in the center?&amp;rdquo; he inquired, searching with his eyes for someone. (Prince Bagratión did not ask about the guns on the left flank; he knew that all the guns there had been abandoned at the very beginning of the action.) &amp;ldquo;I think I sent you?&amp;rdquo; he added, turning to the staff officer on duty.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;One was damaged,&amp;rdquo; answered the staff officer, &amp;ldquo;and the other I can&amp;rsquo;t understand. I was there all the time giving orders and had only just left.... It is true that it was hot there,&amp;rdquo; he added, modestly.</p>
    <p>Someone mentioned that Captain Túshin was bivouacking close to the village and had already been sent for.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Oh, but you were there?&amp;rdquo; said Prince Bagratión, addressing Prince Andrew.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Of course, we only just missed one another,&amp;rdquo; said the staff officer, with a smile to Bolkónski.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I had not the pleasure of seeing you,&amp;rdquo; said Prince Andrew, coldly and abruptly.</p>
    <p>All were silent. Túshin appeared at the threshold and made his way timidly from behind the backs of the generals. As he stepped past the generals in the crowded hut, feeling embarrassed as he always was by the sight of his superiors, he did not notice the staff of the banner and stumbled over it. Several of those present laughed.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;How was it a gun was abandoned?&amp;rdquo; asked Bagratión, frowning, not so much at the captain as at those who were laughing, among whom Zherkóv laughed loudest.</p>
    <p>Only now, when he was confronted by the stern authorities, did his guilt and the disgrace of having lost two guns and yet remaining alive present themselves to Túshin in all their horror. He had been so excited that he had not thought about it until that moment. The officers&amp;rsquo; laughter confused him still more. He stood before Bagratión with his lower jaw trembling and was hardly able to mutter: &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know... your excellency... I had no men... your excellency.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;You might have taken some from the covering troops.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Túshin did not say that there were no covering troops, though that was perfectly true. He was afraid of getting some other officer into trouble, and silently fixed his eyes on Bagratión as a schoolboy who has blundered looks at an examiner.</p>
    <p>The silence lasted some time. Prince Bagratión, apparently not wishing to be severe, found nothing to say; the others did not venture to intervene. Prince Andrew looked at Túshin from under his brows and his fingers twitched nervously.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Your excellency!&amp;rdquo; Prince Andrew broke the silence with his abrupt voice, &amp;ldquo;you were pleased to send me to Captain Túshin&amp;rsquo;s battery. I went there and found two thirds of the men and horses knocked out, two guns smashed, and no supports at all.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Prince Bagratión and Túshin looked with equal intentness at Bolkónski, who spoke with suppressed agitation.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;And, if your excellency will allow me to express my opinion,&amp;rdquo; he continued, &amp;ldquo;we owe today&amp;rsquo;s success chiefly to the action of that battery and the heroic endurance of Captain Túshin and his company,&amp;rdquo; and without awaiting a reply, Prince Andrew rose and left the table.</p>
    <p>Prince Bagratión looked at Túshin, evidently reluctant to show distrust in Bolkónski&amp;rsquo;s emphatic opinion yet not feeling able fully to credit it, bent his head, and told Túshin that he could go. Prince Andrew went out with him.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Thank you; you saved me, my dear fellow!&amp;rdquo; said Túshin.</p>
    <p>Prince Andrew gave him a look, but said nothing and went away. He felt sad and depressed. It was all so strange, so unlike what he had hoped.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Who are they? Why are they here? What do they want? And when will all this end?&amp;rdquo; thought Rostóv, looking at the changing shadows before him. The pain in his arm became more and more intense. Irresistible drowsiness overpowered him, red rings danced before his eyes, and the impression of those voices and faces and a sense of loneliness merged with the physical pain. It was they, these soldiers&amp;mdash;wounded and unwounded&amp;mdash;it was they who were crushing, weighing down, and twisting the sinews and scorching the flesh of his sprained arm and shoulder. To rid himself of them he closed his eyes.</p>
    <p>For a moment he dozed, but in that short interval innumerable things appeared to him in a dream: his mother and her large white hand, Sónya&amp;rsquo;s thin little shoulders, Natásha&amp;rsquo;s eyes and laughter, Denísov with his voice and mustache, and Telyánin and all that affair with Telyánin and Bogdánich. That affair was the same thing as this soldier with the harsh voice, and it was that affair and this soldier that were so agonizingly, incessantly pulling and pressing his arm and always dragging it in one direction. He tried to get away from them, but they would not for an instant let his shoulder move a hair&amp;rsquo;s breadth. It would not ache&amp;mdash;it would be well&amp;mdash;if only they did not pull it, but it was impossible to get rid of them.</p>
    <p>He opened his eyes and looked up. The black canopy of night hung less than a yard above the glow of the charcoal. Flakes of falling snow were fluttering in that light. Túshin had not returned, the doctor had not come. He was alone now, except for a soldier who was sitting naked at the other side of the fire, warming his thin yellow body.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Nobody wants me!&amp;rdquo; thought Rostóv. &amp;ldquo;There is no one to help me or pity me. Yet I was once at home, strong, happy, and loved.&amp;rdquo; He sighed and, doing so, groaned involuntarily.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Eh, is anything hurting you?&amp;rdquo; asked the soldier, shaking his shirt out over the fire, and not waiting for an answer he gave a grunt and added: &amp;ldquo;What a lot of men have been crippled today&amp;mdash;frightful!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Rostóv did not listen to the soldier. He looked at the snowflakes fluttering above the fire and remembered a Russian winter at his warm, bright home, his fluffy fur coat, his quickly gliding sleigh, his healthy body, and all the affection and care of his family. &amp;ldquo;And why did I come here?&amp;rdquo; he wondered.</p>
    <p>Next day the French army did not renew their attack, and the remnant of Bagratión&amp;rsquo;s detachment was reunited to Kutúzov&amp;rsquo;s army.</p>
    <h2>BOOK THREE: 1805</h2>
    <h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
    <p>Prince Vasíli was not a man who deliberately thought out his plans. Still less did he think of injuring anyone for his own advantage. He was merely a man of the world who had got on and to whom getting on had become a habit. Schemes and devices for which he never rightly accounted to himself, but which formed the whole interest of his life, were constantly shaping themselves in his mind, arising from the circumstances and persons he met. Of these plans he had not merely one or two in his head but dozens, some only beginning to form themselves, some approaching achievement, and some in course of disintegration. He did not, for instance, say to himself: &amp;ldquo;This man now has influence, I must gain his confidence and friendship and through him obtain a special grant.&amp;rdquo; Nor did he say to himself: &amp;ldquo;Pierre is a rich man, I must entice him to marry my daughter and lend me the forty thousand rubles I need.&amp;rdquo; But when he came across a man of position his instinct immediately told him that this man could be useful, and without any premeditation Prince Vasíli took the first opportunity to gain his confidence, flatter him, become intimate with him, and finally make his request.</p>
    <p>He had Pierre at hand in Moscow and procured for him an appointment as Gentleman of the Bedchamber, which at that time conferred the status of Councilor of State, and insisted on the young man accompanying him to Petersburg and staying at his house. With apparent absent-mindedness, yet with unhesitating assurance that he was doing the right thing, Prince Vasíli did everything to get Pierre to marry his daughter. Had he thought out his plans beforehand he could not have been so natural and shown such unaffected familiarity in intercourse with everybody both above and below him in social standing. Something always drew him toward those richer and more powerful than himself and he had rare skill in seizing the most opportune moment for making use of people.</p>
    <p>Pierre, on unexpectedly becoming Count Bezúkhov and a rich man, felt himself after his recent loneliness and freedom from cares so beset and preoccupied that only in bed was he able to be by himself. He had to sign papers, to present himself at government offices, the purpose of which was not clear to him, to question his chief steward, to visit his estate near Moscow, and to receive many people who formerly did not even wish to know of his existence but would now have been offended and grieved had he chosen not to see them. These different people&amp;mdash;businessmen, relations, and acquaintances alike&amp;mdash;were all disposed to treat the young heir in the most friendly and flattering manner: they were all evidently firmly convinced of Pierre&amp;rsquo;s noble qualities. He was always hearing such words as: &amp;ldquo;With your remarkable kindness,&amp;rdquo; or, &amp;ldquo;With your excellent heart,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;You are yourself so honorable, Count,&amp;rdquo; or, &amp;ldquo;Were he as clever as you,&amp;rdquo; and so on, till he began sincerely to believe in his own exceptional kindness and extraordinary intelligence, the more so as in the depth of his heart it had always seemed to him that he really was very kind and intelligent. Even people who had formerly been spiteful toward him and evidently unfriendly now became gentle and affectionate. The angry eldest princess, with the long waist and hair plastered down like a doll&amp;rsquo;s, had come into Pierre&amp;rsquo;s room after the funeral. With drooping eyes and frequent blushes she told him she was very sorry about their past misunderstandings and did not now feel she had a right to ask him for anything, except only for permission, after the blow she had received, to remain for a few weeks longer in the house she so loved and where she had sacrificed so much. She could not refrain from weeping at these words. Touched that this statuesque princess could so change, Pierre took her hand and begged her forgiveness, without knowing what for. From that day the eldest princess quite changed toward Pierre and began knitting a striped scarf for him.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Do this for my sake, <i>mon cher</i>; after all, she had to put up with a great deal from the deceased,&amp;rdquo; said Prince Vasíli to him, handing him a deed to sign for the princess&amp;rsquo; benefit.</p>
    <p>Prince Vasíli had come to the conclusion that it was necessary to throw this bone&amp;mdash;a bill for thirty thousand rubles&amp;mdash;to the poor princess that it might not occur to her to speak of his share in the affair of the inlaid portfolio. Pierre signed the deed and after that the princess grew still kinder. The younger sisters also became affectionate to him, especially the youngest, the pretty one with the mole, who often made him feel confused by her smiles and her own confusion when meeting him.</p>
    <p>It seemed so natural to Pierre that everyone should like him, and it would have seemed so unnatural had anyone disliked him, that he could not but believe in the sincerity of those around him. Besides, he had no time to ask himself whether these people were sincere or not. He was always busy and always felt in a state of mild and cheerful intoxication. He felt as though he were the center of some important and general movement; that something was constantly expected of him, that if he did not do it he would grieve and disappoint many people, but if he did this and that, all would be well; and he did what was demanded of him, but still that happy result always remained in the future.</p>
    <p>More than anyone else, Prince Vasíli took possession of Pierre&amp;rsquo;s affairs and of Pierre himself in those early days. From the death of Count Bezúkhov he did not let go his hold of the lad. He had the air of a man oppressed by business, weary and suffering, who yet would not, for pity&amp;rsquo;s sake, leave this helpless youth who, after all, was the son of his old friend and the possessor of such enormous wealth, to the caprice of fate and the designs of rogues. During the few days he spent in Moscow after the death of Count Bezúkhov, he would call Pierre, or go to him himself, and tell him what ought to be done in a tone of weariness and assurance, as if he were adding every time: &amp;ldquo;You know I am overwhelmed with business and it is purely out of charity that I trouble myself about you, and you also know quite well that what I propose is the only thing possible.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well, my dear fellow, tomorrow we are off at last,&amp;rdquo; said Prince Vasíli one day, closing his eyes and fingering Pierre&amp;rsquo;s elbow, speaking as if he were saying something which had long since been agreed upon and could not now be altered. &amp;ldquo;We start tomorrow and I&amp;rsquo;m giving you a place in my carriage. I am very glad. All our important business here is now settled, and I ought to have been off long ago. Here is something I have received from the chancellor. I asked him for you, and you have been entered in the diplomatic corps and made a Gentleman of the Bedchamber. The diplomatic career now lies open before you.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Notwithstanding the tone of wearied assurance with which these words were pronounced, Pierre, who had so long been considering his career, wished to make some suggestion. But Prince Vasíli interrupted him in the special deep cooing tone, precluding the possibility of interrupting his speech, which he used in extreme cases when special persuasion was needed.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;<i>Mais, mon cher</i>, I did this for my own sake, to satisfy my conscience, and there is nothing to thank me for. No one has ever complained yet of being too much loved; and besides, you are free, you could throw it up tomorrow. But you will see everything for yourself when you get to Petersburg. It is high time for you to get away from these terrible recollections.&amp;rdquo; Prince Vasíli sighed. &amp;ldquo;Yes, yes, my boy. And my valet can go in your carriage. Ah! I was nearly forgetting,&amp;rdquo; he added. &amp;ldquo;You know, <i>mon cher</i>, your father and I had some accounts to settle, so I have received what was due from the Ryazán estate and will keep it; you won&amp;rsquo;t require it. We&amp;rsquo;ll go into the accounts later.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>By &amp;ldquo;what was due from the Ryazán estate&amp;rdquo; Prince Vasíli meant several thousand rubles quitrent received from Pierre&amp;rsquo;s peasants, which the prince had retained for himself.</p>
    <p>In Petersburg, as in Moscow, Pierre found the same atmosphere of gentleness and affection. He could not refuse the post, or rather the rank (for he did nothing), that Prince Vasíli had procured for him, and acquaintances, invitations, and social occupations were so numerous that, even more than in Moscow, he felt a sense of bewilderment, bustle, and continual expectation of some good, always in front of him but never attained.</p>
    <p>Of his former bachelor acquaintances many were no longer in Petersburg. The Guards had gone to the front; Dólokhov had been reduced to the ranks; Anatole was in the army somewhere in the provinces; Prince Andrew was abroad; so Pierre had not the opportunity to spend his nights as he used to like to spend them, or to open his mind by intimate talks with a friend older than himself and whom he respected. His whole time was taken up with dinners and balls and was spent chiefly at Prince Vasíli&amp;rsquo;s house in the company of the stout princess, his wife, and his beautiful daughter Hélène.</p>
    <p>Like the others, Anna Pávlovna Schérer showed Pierre the change of attitude toward him that had taken place in society.</p>
    <p>Formerly in Anna Pávlovna&amp;rsquo;s presence, Pierre had always felt that what he was saying was out of place, tactless and unsuitable, that remarks which seemed to him clever while they formed in his mind became foolish as soon as he uttered them, while on the contrary Hippolyte&amp;rsquo;s stupidest remarks came out clever and apt. Now everything Pierre said was <i>charmant</i>. Even if Anna Pávlovna did not say so, he could see that she wished to and only refrained out of regard for his modesty.</p>
    <p>In the beginning of the winter of 1805-6 Pierre received one of Anna Pávlovna&amp;rsquo;s usual pink notes with an invitation to which was added: &amp;ldquo;You will find the beautiful Hélène here, whom it is always delightful to see.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>When he read that sentence, Pierre felt for the first time that some link which other people recognized had grown up between himself and Hélène, and that thought both alarmed him, as if some obligation were being imposed on him which he could not fulfill, and pleased him as an entertaining supposition.</p>
    <p>Anna Pávlovna&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;At Home&amp;rdquo; was like the former one, only the novelty she offered her guests this time was not Mortemart, but a diplomatist fresh from Berlin with the very latest details of the Emperor Alexander&amp;rsquo;s visit to Potsdam, and of how the two august friends had pledged themselves in an indissoluble alliance to uphold the cause of justice against the enemy of the human race. Anna Pávlovna received Pierre with a shade of melancholy, evidently relating to the young man&amp;rsquo;s recent loss by the death of Count Bezúkhov (everyone constantly considered it a duty to assure Pierre that he was greatly afflicted by the death of the father he had hardly known), and her melancholy was just like the august melancholy she showed at the mention of her most august Majesty the Empress Márya Fëdorovna. Pierre felt flattered by this. Anna Pávlovna arranged the different groups in her drawing room with her habitual skill. The large group, in which were Prince Vasíli and the generals, had the benefit of the diplomat. Another group was at the tea table. Pierre wished to join the former, but Anna Pávlovna&amp;mdash;who was in the excited condition of a commander on a battlefield to whom thousands of new and brilliant ideas occur which there is hardly time to put in action&amp;mdash;seeing Pierre, touched his sleeve with her finger, saying:</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Wait a bit, I have something in view for you this evening.&amp;rdquo; (She glanced at Hélène and smiled at her.) &amp;ldquo;My dear Hélène, be charitable to my poor aunt who adores you. Go and keep her company for ten minutes. And that it will not be too dull, here is the dear count who will not refuse to accompany you.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The beauty went to the aunt, but Anna Pávlovna detained Pierre, looking as if she had to give some final necessary instructions.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Isn&amp;rsquo;t she exquisite?&amp;rdquo; she said to Pierre, pointing to the stately beauty as she glided away. &amp;ldquo;And how she carries herself! For so young a girl, such tact, such masterly perfection of manner! It comes from her heart. Happy the man who wins her! With her the least worldly of men would occupy a most brilliant position in society. Don&amp;rsquo;t you think so? I only wanted to know your opinion,&amp;rdquo; and Anna Pávlovna let Pierre go.</p>
    <p>Pierre, in reply, sincerely agreed with her as to Hélène&amp;rsquo;s perfection of manner. If he ever thought of Hélène, it was just of her beauty and her remarkable skill in appearing silently dignified in society.</p>
    <p>The old aunt received the two young people in her corner, but seemed desirous of hiding her adoration for Hélène and inclined rather to show her fear of Anna Pávlovna. She looked at her niece, as if inquiring what she was to do with these people. On leaving them, Anna Pávlovna again touched Pierre&amp;rsquo;s sleeve, saying: &amp;ldquo;I hope you won&amp;rsquo;t say that it is dull in my house again,&amp;rdquo; and she glanced at Hélène.</p>
    <p>Hélène smiled, with a look implying that she did not admit the possibility of anyone seeing her without being enchanted. The aunt coughed, swallowed, and said in French that she was very pleased to see Hélène, then she turned to Pierre with the same words of welcome and the same look. In the middle of a dull and halting conversation, Hélène turned to Pierre with the beautiful bright smile that she gave to everyone. Pierre was so used to that smile, and it had so little meaning for him, that he paid no attention to it. The aunt was just speaking of a collection of snuffboxes that had belonged to Pierre&amp;rsquo;s father, Count Bezúkhov, and showed them her own box. Princess Hélène asked to see the portrait of the aunt&amp;rsquo;s husband on the box lid.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;That is probably the work of Vinesse,&amp;rdquo; said Pierre, mentioning a celebrated miniaturist, and he leaned over the table to take the snuffbox while trying to hear what was being said at the other table.</p>
    <p>He half rose, meaning to go round, but the aunt handed him the snuffbox, passing it across Hélène&amp;rsquo;s back. Hélène stooped forward to make room, and looked round with a smile. She was, as always at evening parties, wearing a dress such as was then fashionable, cut very low at front and back. Her bust, which had always seemed like marble to Pierre, was so close to him that his shortsighted eyes could not but perceive the living charm of her neck and shoulders, so near to his lips that he need only have bent his head a little to have touched them. He was conscious of the warmth of her body, the scent of perfume, and the creaking of her corset as she moved. He did not see her marble beauty forming a complete whole with her dress, but all the charm of her body only covered by her garments. And having once seen this he could not help being aware of it, just as we cannot renew an illusion we have once seen through.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;So you have never noticed before how beautiful I am?&amp;rdquo; Hélène seemed to say. &amp;ldquo;You had not noticed that I am a woman? Yes, I am a woman who may belong to anyone&amp;mdash;to you too,&amp;rdquo; said her glance. And at that moment Pierre felt that Hélène not only could, but must, be his wife, and that it could not be otherwise.</p>
    <p>He knew this at that moment as surely as if he had been standing at the altar with her. How and when this would be he did not know, he did not even know if it would be a good thing (he even felt, he knew not why, that it would be a bad thing), but he knew it would happen.</p>
    <p>Pierre dropped his eyes, lifted them again, and wished once more to see her as a distant beauty far removed from him, as he had seen her every day until then, but he could no longer do it. He could not, any more than a man who has been looking at a tuft of steppe grass through the mist and taking it for a tree can again take it for a tree after he has once recognized it to be a tuft of grass. She was terribly close to him. She already had power over him, and between them there was no longer any barrier except the barrier of his own will.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well, I will leave you in your little corner,&amp;rdquo; came Anna Pávlovna&amp;rsquo;s voice, &amp;ldquo;I see you are all right there.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>And Pierre, anxiously trying to remember whether he had done anything reprehensible, looked round with a blush. It seemed to him that everyone knew what had happened to him as he knew it himself.</p>
    <p>A little later when he went up to the large circle, Anna Pávlovna said to him: &amp;ldquo;I hear you are refitting your Petersburg house?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>This was true. The architect had told him that it was necessary, and Pierre, without knowing why, was having his enormous Petersburg house done up.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s a good thing, but don&amp;rsquo;t move from Prince Vasíli&amp;rsquo;s. It is good to have a friend like the prince,&amp;rdquo; she said, smiling at Prince Vasíli. &amp;ldquo;I know something about that. Don&amp;rsquo;t I? And you are still so young. You need advice. Don&amp;rsquo;t be angry with me for exercising an old woman&amp;rsquo;s privilege.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>She paused, as women always do, expecting something after they have mentioned their age. &amp;ldquo;If you marry it will be a different thing,&amp;rdquo; she continued, uniting them both in one glance. Pierre did not look at Hélène nor she at him. But she was just as terribly close to him. He muttered something and colored.</p>
    <p>When he got home he could not sleep for a long time for thinking of what had happened. What had happened? Nothing. He had merely understood that the woman he had known as a child, of whom when her beauty was mentioned he had said absent-mindedly: &amp;ldquo;Yes, she&amp;rsquo;s good looking,&amp;rdquo; he had understood that this woman might belong to him.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;But she&amp;rsquo;s stupid. I have myself said she is stupid,&amp;rdquo; he thought. &amp;ldquo;There is something nasty, something wrong, in the feeling she excites in me. I have been told that her brother Anatole was in love with her and she with him, that there was quite a scandal and that that&amp;rsquo;s why he was sent away. Hippolyte is her brother... Prince Vasíli is her father... It&amp;rsquo;s bad....&amp;rdquo; he reflected, but while he was thinking this (the reflection was still incomplete), he caught himself smiling and was conscious that another line of thought had sprung up, and while thinking of her worthlessness he was also dreaming of how she would be his wife, how she would love him become quite different, and how all he had thought and heard of her might be false. And he again saw her not as the daughter of Prince Vasíli, but visualized her whole body only veiled by its gray dress. &amp;ldquo;But no! Why did this thought never occur to me before?&amp;rdquo; and again he told himself that it was impossible, that there would be something unnatural, and as it seemed to him dishonorable, in this marriage. He recalled her former words and looks and the words and looks of those who had seen them together. He recalled Anna Pávlovna&amp;rsquo;s words and looks when she spoke to him about his house, recalled thousands of such hints from Prince Vasíli and others, and was seized by terror lest he had already, in some way, bound himself to do something that was evidently wrong and that he ought not to do. But at the very time he was expressing this conviction to himself, in another part of his mind her image rose in all its womanly beauty.</p>
    <h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
    <p>In November, 1805, Prince Vasíli had to go on a tour of inspection in four different provinces. He had arranged this for himself so as to visit his neglected estates at the same time and pick up his son Anatole where his regiment was stationed, and take him to visit Prince Nicholas Bolkónski in order to arrange a match for him with the daughter of that rich old man. But before leaving home and undertaking these new affairs, Prince Vasíli had to settle matters with Pierre, who, it is true, had latterly spent whole days at home, that is, in Prince Vasíli&amp;rsquo;s house where he was staying, and had been absurd, excited, and foolish in Hélène&amp;rsquo;s presence (as a lover should be), but had not yet proposed to her.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;This is all very fine, but things must be settled,&amp;rdquo; said Prince Vasíli to himself, with a sorrowful sigh, one morning, feeling that Pierre who was under such obligations to him (&amp;ldquo;But never mind that&amp;rdquo;) was not behaving very well in this matter. &amp;ldquo;Youth, frivolity... well, God be with him,&amp;rdquo; thought he, relishing his own goodness of heart, &amp;ldquo;but it must be brought to a head. The day after tomorrow will be Lëlya&amp;rsquo;s name day. I will invite two or three people, and if he does not understand what he ought to do then it will be my affair&amp;mdash;yes, my affair. I am her father.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Six weeks after Anna Pávlovna&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;At Home&amp;rdquo; and after the sleepless night when he had decided that to marry Hélène would be a calamity and that he ought to avoid her and go away, Pierre, despite that decision, had not left Prince Vasíli&amp;rsquo;s and felt with terror that in people&amp;rsquo;s eyes he was every day more and more connected with her, that it was impossible for him to return to his former conception of her, that he could not break away from her, and that though it would be a terrible thing he would have to unite his fate with hers. He might perhaps have been able to free himself but that Prince Vasíli (who had rarely before given receptions) now hardly let a day go by without having an evening party at which Pierre had to be present unless he wished to spoil the general pleasure and disappoint everyone&amp;rsquo;s expectation. Prince Vasíli, in the rare moments when he was at home, would take Pierre&amp;rsquo;s hand in passing and draw it downwards, or absent-mindedly hold out his wrinkled, clean-shaven cheek for Pierre to kiss and would say: &amp;ldquo;Till tomorrow,&amp;rdquo; or, &amp;ldquo;Be in to dinner or I shall not see you,&amp;rdquo; or, &amp;ldquo;I am staying in for your sake,&amp;rdquo; and so on. And though Prince Vasíli, when he stayed in (as he said) for Pierre&amp;rsquo;s sake, hardly exchanged a couple of words with him, Pierre felt unable to disappoint him. Every day he said to himself one and the same thing: &amp;ldquo;It is time I understood her and made up my mind what she really is. Was I mistaken before, or am I mistaken now? No, she is not stupid, she is an excellent girl,&amp;rdquo; he sometimes said to himself &amp;ldquo;she never makes a mistake, never says anything stupid. She says little, but what she does say is always clear and simple, so she is not stupid. She never was abashed and is not abashed now, so she cannot be a bad woman!&amp;rdquo; He had often begun to make reflections or think aloud in her company, and she had always answered him either by a brief but appropriate remark&amp;mdash;showing that it did not interest her&amp;mdash;or by a silent look and smile which more palpably than anything else showed Pierre her superiority. She was right in regarding all arguments as nonsense in comparison with that smile.</p>
    <p>She always addressed him with a radiantly confiding smile meant for him alone, in which there was something more significant than in the general smile that usually brightened her face. Pierre knew that everyone was waiting for him to say a word and cross a certain line, and he knew that sooner or later he would step across it, but an incomprehensible terror seized him at the thought of that dreadful step. A thousand times during that month and a half while he felt himself drawn nearer and nearer to that dreadful abyss, Pierre said to himself: &amp;ldquo;What am I doing? I need resolution. Can it be that I have none?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>He wished to take a decision, but felt with dismay that in this matter he lacked that strength of will which he had known in himself and really possessed. Pierre was one of those who are only strong when they feel themselves quite innocent, and since that day when he was overpowered by a feeling of desire while stooping over the snuffbox at Anna Pávlovna&amp;rsquo;s, an unacknowledged sense of the guilt of that desire paralyzed his will.</p>
    <p>On Hélène&amp;rsquo;s name day, a small party of just their own people&amp;mdash;as his wife said&amp;mdash;met for supper at Prince Vasíli&amp;rsquo;s. All these friends and relations had been given to understand that the fate of the young girl would be decided that evening. The visitors were seated at supper. Princess Kurágina, a portly imposing woman who had once been handsome, was sitting at the head of the table. On either side of her sat the more important guests&amp;mdash;an old general and his wife, and Anna Pávlovna Schérer. At the other end sat the younger and less important guests, and there too sat the members of the family, and Pierre and Hélène, side by side. Prince Vasíli was not having any supper: he went round the table in a merry mood, sitting down now by one, now by another, of the guests. To each of them he made some careless and agreeable remark except to Pierre and Hélène, whose presence he seemed not to notice. He enlivened the whole party. The wax candles burned brightly, the silver and crystal gleamed, so did the ladies&amp;rsquo; toilets and the gold and silver of the men&amp;rsquo;s epaulets; servants in scarlet liveries moved round the table, the clatter of plates, knives, and glasses mingled with the animated hum of several conversations. At one end of the table, the old chamberlain was heard assuring an old baroness that he loved her passionately, at which she laughed; at the other could be heard the story of the misfortunes of some Mary Víktorovna or other. At the center of the table, Prince Vasíli attracted everybody&amp;rsquo;s attention. With a facetious smile on his face, he was telling the ladies about last Wednesday&amp;rsquo;s meeting of the Imperial Council, at which Sergéy Kuzmích Vyazmítinov, the new military governor general of Petersburg, had received and read the then famous rescript of the Emperor Alexander from the army to Sergéy Kuzmích, in which the Emperor said that he was receiving from all sides declarations of the people&amp;rsquo;s loyalty, that the declaration from Petersburg gave him particular pleasure, and that he was proud to be at the head of such a nation and would endeavor to be worthy of it. This rescript began with the words: &amp;ldquo;Sergéy Kuzmích, From all sides reports reach me,&amp;rdquo; etc.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well, and so he never got farther than: &amp;lsquo;Sergéy Kuzmích&amp;rsquo;?&amp;rdquo; asked one of the ladies.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Exactly, not a hair&amp;rsquo;s breadth farther,&amp;rdquo; answered Prince Vasíli, laughing, &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Sergéy Kuzmích... From all sides... From all sides... Sergéy Kuzmích...&amp;rsquo; Poor Vyazmítinov could not get any farther! He began the rescript again and again, but as soon as he uttered <i>&amp;lsquo;Sergéy&amp;rsquo;</i> he sobbed, <i>&amp;lsquo;Kuz-mí-ch,&amp;rsquo;</i> tears, and <i>&amp;lsquo;From all sides&amp;rsquo;</i> was smothered in sobs and he could get no farther. And again his handkerchief, and again: <i>&amp;lsquo;Sergéy Kuzmích, From all sides,&amp;rsquo;</i>... and tears, till at last somebody else was asked to read it.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Kuzmích... From all sides... and then tears,&amp;rdquo; someone repeated laughing.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t be unkind,&amp;rdquo; cried Anna Pávlovna from her end of the table holding up a threatening finger. &amp;ldquo;He is such a worthy and excellent man, our dear Vyazmítinov....&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Everybody laughed a great deal. At the head of the table, where the honored guests sat, everyone seemed to be in high spirits and under the influence of a variety of exciting sensations. Only Pierre and Hélène sat silently side by side almost at the bottom of the table, a suppressed smile brightening both their faces, a smile that had nothing to do with Sergéy Kuzmích&amp;mdash;a smile of bashfulness at their own feelings. But much as all the rest laughed, talked, and joked, much as they enjoyed their Rhine wine, <i>sauté</i>, and ices, and however they avoided looking at the young couple, and heedless and unobservant as they seemed of them, one could feel by the occasional glances they gave that the story about Sergéy Kuzmích, the laughter, and the food were all a pretense, and that the whole attention of that company was directed to&amp;mdash;Pierre and Hélène. Prince Vasíli mimicked the sobbing of Sergéy Kuzmích and at the same time his eyes glanced toward his daughter, and while he laughed the expression on his face clearly said: &amp;ldquo;Yes... it&amp;rsquo;s getting on, it will all be settled today.&amp;rdquo; Anna Pávlovna threatened him on behalf of &amp;ldquo;our dear Vyazmítinov,&amp;rdquo; and in her eyes, which, for an instant, glanced at Pierre, Prince Vasíli read a congratulation on his future son-in-law and on his daughter&amp;rsquo;s happiness. The old princess sighed sadly as she offered some wine to the old lady next to her and glanced angrily at her daughter, and her sigh seemed to say: &amp;ldquo;Yes, there&amp;rsquo;s nothing left for you and me but to sip sweet wine, my dear, now that the time has come for these young ones to be thus boldly, provocatively happy.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;And what nonsense all this is that I am saying!&amp;rdquo; thought a diplomatist, glancing at the happy faces of the lovers. &amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s happiness!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Into the insignificant, trifling, and artificial interests uniting that society had entered the simple feeling of the attraction of a healthy and handsome young man and woman for one another. And this human feeling dominated everything else and soared above all their affected chatter. Jests fell flat, news was not interesting, and the animation was evidently forced. Not only the guests but even the footmen waiting at table seemed to feel this, and they forgot their duties as they looked at the beautiful Hélène with her radiant face and at the red, broad, and happy though uneasy face of Pierre. It seemed as if the very light of the candles was focused on those two happy faces alone.</p>
    <p>Pierre felt that he was the center of it all, and this both pleased and embarrassed him. He was like a man entirely absorbed in some occupation. He did not see, hear, or understand anything clearly. Only now and then detached ideas and impressions from the world of reality shot unexpectedly through his mind.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;So it is all finished!&amp;rdquo; he thought. &amp;ldquo;And how has it all happened? How quickly! Now I know that not because of her alone, nor of myself alone, but because of everyone, <i>it</i> must inevitably come about. They are all expecting <i>it</i>, they are so sure that it will happen that I cannot, I cannot, disappoint them. But how will it be? I do not know, but it will certainly happen!&amp;rdquo; thought Pierre, glancing at those dazzling shoulders close to his eyes.</p>
    <p>Or he would suddenly feel ashamed of he knew not what. He felt it awkward to attract everyone&amp;rsquo;s attention and to be considered a lucky man and, with his plain face, to be looked on as a sort of Paris possessed of a Helen. &amp;ldquo;But no doubt it always is and must be so!&amp;rdquo; he consoled himself. &amp;ldquo;And besides, what have I done to bring it about? How did it begin? I traveled from Moscow with Prince Vasíli. Then there was nothing. So why should I not stay at his house? Then I played cards with her and picked up her reticule and drove out with her. How did it begin, when did it all come about?&amp;rdquo; And here he was sitting by her side as her betrothed, seeing, hearing, feeling her nearness, her breathing, her movements, her beauty. Then it would suddenly seem to him that it was not she but he was so unusually beautiful, and that that was why they all looked so at him, and flattered by this general admiration he would expand his chest, raise his head, and rejoice at his good fortune. Suddenly he heard a familiar voice repeating something to him a second time. But Pierre was so absorbed that he did not understand what was said.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I am asking you when you last heard from Bolkónski,&amp;rdquo; repeated Prince Vasíli a third time. &amp;ldquo;How absent-minded you are, my dear fellow.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Prince Vasíli smiled, and Pierre noticed that everyone was smiling at him and Hélène. &amp;ldquo;Well, what of it, if you all know it?&amp;rdquo; thought Pierre. &amp;ldquo;What of it? It&amp;rsquo;s the truth!&amp;rdquo; and he himself smiled his gentle childlike smile, and Hélène smiled too.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;When did you get the letter? Was it from Olmütz?&amp;rdquo; repeated Prince Vasíli, who pretended to want to know this in order to settle a dispute.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;How can one talk or think of such trifles?&amp;rdquo; thought Pierre.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Yes, from Olmütz,&amp;rdquo; he answered, with a sigh.</p>
    <p>After supper Pierre with his partner followed the others into the drawing room. The guests began to disperse, some without taking leave of Hélène. Some, as if unwilling to distract her from an important occupation, came up to her for a moment and made haste to go away, refusing to let her see them off. The diplomatist preserved a mournful silence as he left the drawing room. He pictured the vanity of his diplomatic career in comparison with Pierre&amp;rsquo;s happiness. The old general grumbled at his wife when she asked how his leg was. &amp;ldquo;Oh, the old fool,&amp;rdquo; he thought. &amp;ldquo;That Princess Hélène will be beautiful still when she&amp;rsquo;s fifty.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I think I may congratulate you,&amp;rdquo; whispered Anna Pávlovna to the old princess, kissing her soundly. &amp;ldquo;If I hadn&amp;rsquo;t this headache I&amp;rsquo;d have stayed longer.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The old princess did not reply, she was tormented by jealousy of her daughter&amp;rsquo;s happiness.</p>
    <p>While the guests were taking their leave Pierre remained for a long time alone with Hélène in the little drawing room where they were sitting. He had often before, during the last six weeks, remained alone with her, but had never spoken to her of love. Now he felt that it was inevitable, but he could not make up his mind to take the final step. He felt ashamed; he felt that he was occupying someone else&amp;rsquo;s place here beside Hélène. &amp;ldquo;This happiness is not for you,&amp;rdquo; some inner voice whispered to him. &amp;ldquo;This happiness is for those who have not in them what there is in you.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>But, as he had to say something, he began by asking her whether she was satisfied with the party. She replied in her usual simple manner that this name day of hers had been one of the pleasantest she had ever had.</p>
    <p>Some of the nearest relatives had not yet left. They were sitting in the large drawing room. Prince Vasíli came up to Pierre with languid footsteps. Pierre rose and said it was getting late. Prince Vasíli gave him a look of stern inquiry, as though what Pierre had just said was so strange that one could not take it in. But then the expression of severity changed, and he drew Pierre&amp;rsquo;s hand downwards, made him sit down, and smiled affectionately.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well, Lëlya?&amp;rdquo; he asked, turning instantly to his daughter and addressing her with the careless tone of habitual tenderness natural to parents who have petted their children from babyhood, but which Prince Vasíli had only acquired by imitating other parents.</p>
    <p>And he again turned to Pierre.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Sergéy Kuzmích&amp;mdash;From all sides&amp;mdash;&amp;rdquo; he said, unbuttoning the top button of his waistcoat.</p>
    <p>Pierre smiled, but his smile showed that he knew it was not the story about Sergéy Kuzmích that interested Prince Vasíli just then, and Prince Vasíli saw that Pierre knew this. He suddenly muttered something and went away. It seemed to Pierre that even the prince was disconcerted. The sight of the discomposure of that old man of the world touched Pierre: he looked at Hélène and she too seemed disconcerted, and her look seemed to say: &amp;ldquo;Well, it is your own fault.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;The step must be taken but I cannot, I cannot!&amp;rdquo; thought Pierre, and he again began speaking about indifferent matters, about Sergéy Kuzmích, asking what the point of the story was as he had not heard it properly. Hélène answered with a smile that she too had missed it.</p>
    <p>When Prince Vasíli returned to the drawing room, the princess, his wife, was talking in low tones to the elderly lady about Pierre.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Of course, it is a very brilliant match, but happiness, my dear...&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Marriages are made in heaven,&amp;rdquo; replied the elderly lady.</p>
    <p>Prince Vasíli passed by, seeming not to hear the ladies, and sat down on a sofa in a far corner of the room. He closed his eyes and seemed to be dozing. His head sank forward and then he roused himself.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Aline,&amp;rdquo; he said to his wife, &amp;ldquo;go and see what they are about.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The princess went up to the door, passed by it with a dignified and indifferent air, and glanced into the little drawing room. Pierre and Hélène still sat talking just as before.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Still the same,&amp;rdquo; she said to her husband.</p>
    <p>Prince Vasíli frowned, twisting his mouth, his cheeks quivered and his face assumed the coarse, unpleasant expression peculiar to him. Shaking himself, he rose, threw back his head, and with resolute steps went past the ladies into the little drawing room. With quick steps he went joyfully up to Pierre. His face was so unusually triumphant that Pierre rose in alarm on seeing it.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Thank God!&amp;rdquo; said Prince Vasíli. &amp;ldquo;My wife has told me everything!&amp;rdquo; (He put one arm around Pierre and the other around his daughter.)&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;My dear boy... Lëlya... I am very pleased.&amp;rdquo; (His voice trembled.) &amp;ldquo;I loved your father... and she will make you a good wife... God bless you!...&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>He embraced his daughter, and then again Pierre, and kissed him with his malodorous mouth. Tears actually moistened his cheeks.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Princess, come here!&amp;rdquo; he shouted.</p>
    <p>The old princess came in and also wept. The elderly lady was using her handkerchief too. Pierre was kissed, and he kissed the beautiful Hélène&amp;rsquo;s hand several times. After a while they were left alone again.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;All this had to be and could not be otherwise,&amp;rdquo; thought Pierre, &amp;ldquo;so it is useless to ask whether it is good or bad. It is good because it&amp;rsquo;s definite and one is rid of the old tormenting doubt.&amp;rdquo; Pierre held the hand of his betrothed in silence, looking at her beautiful bosom as it rose and fell.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Hélène!&amp;rdquo; he said aloud and paused.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Something special is always said in such cases,&amp;rdquo; he thought, but could not remember what it was that people say. He looked at her face. She drew nearer to him. Her face flushed.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Oh, take those off... those...&amp;rdquo; she said, pointing to his spectacles.</p>
    <p>Pierre took them off, and his eyes, besides the strange look eyes have from which spectacles have just been removed, had also a frightened and inquiring look. He was about to stoop over her hand and kiss it, but with a rapid, almost brutal movement of her head, she intercepted his lips and met them with her own. Her face struck Pierre, by its altered, unpleasantly excited expression.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;It is too late now, it&amp;rsquo;s done; besides I love her,&amp;rdquo; thought Pierre.</p>
    <p><i>&amp;ldquo;Je vous aime!&amp;rdquo;</i> * he said, remembering what has to be said at such moments: but his words sounded so weak that he felt ashamed of himself.</p>
    <pre class="testable">* &amp;ldquo;I love you.&amp;rdquo;</pre>
    <p>Six weeks later he was married, and settled in Count Bezúkhov&amp;rsquo;s large, newly furnished Petersburg house, the happy possessor, as people said, of a wife who was a celebrated beauty and of millions of money.</p>
    <h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
    <p>Old Prince Nicholas Bolkónski received a letter from Prince Vasíli in November, 1805, announcing that he and his son would be paying him a visit. &amp;ldquo;I am starting on a journey of inspection, and of course I shall think nothing of an extra seventy miles to come and see you at the same time, my honored benefactor,&amp;rdquo; wrote Prince Vasíli. &amp;ldquo;My son Anatole is accompanying me on his way to the army, so I hope you will allow him personally to express the deep respect that, emulating his father, he feels for you.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;It seems that there will be no need to bring Mary out, suitors are coming to us of their own accord,&amp;rdquo; incautiously remarked the little princess on hearing the news.</p>
    <p>Prince Nicholas frowned, but said nothing.</p>
    <p>A fortnight after the letter Prince Vasíli&amp;rsquo;s servants came one evening in advance of him, and he and his son arrived next day.</p>
    <p>Old Bolkónski had always had a poor opinion of Prince Vasíli&amp;rsquo;s character, but more so recently, since in the new reigns of Paul and Alexander Prince Vasíli had risen to high position and honors. And now, from the hints contained in his letter and given by the little princess, he saw which way the wind was blowing, and his low opinion changed into a feeling of contemptuous ill will. He snorted whenever he mentioned him. On the day of Prince Vasíli&amp;rsquo;s arrival, Prince Bolkónski was particularly discontented and out of temper. Whether he was in a bad temper because Prince Vasíli was coming, or whether his being in a bad temper made him specially annoyed at Prince Vasíli&amp;rsquo;s visit, he was in a bad temper, and in the morning Tíkhon had already advised the architect not to go to the prince with his report.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Do you hear how he&amp;rsquo;s walking?&amp;rdquo; said Tíkhon, drawing the architect&amp;rsquo;s attention to the sound of the prince&amp;rsquo;s footsteps. &amp;ldquo;Stepping flat on his heels&amp;mdash;we know what that means....&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>However, at nine o&amp;rsquo;clock the prince, in his velvet coat with a sable collar and cap, went out for his usual walk. It had snowed the day before and the path to the hothouse, along which the prince was in the habit of walking, had been swept: the marks of the broom were still visible in the snow and a shovel had been left sticking in one of the soft snowbanks that bordered both sides of the path. The prince went through the conservatories, the serfs&amp;rsquo; quarters, and the outbuildings, frowning and silent.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Can a sleigh pass?&amp;rdquo; he asked his overseer, a venerable man, resembling his master in manners and looks, who was accompanying him back to the house.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;The snow is deep. I am having the avenue swept, your honor.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The prince bowed his head and went up to the porch. &amp;ldquo;God be thanked,&amp;rdquo; thought the overseer, &amp;ldquo;the storm has blown over!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;It would have been hard to drive up, your honor,&amp;rdquo; he added. &amp;ldquo;I heard, your honor, that a minister is coming to visit your honor.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The prince turned round to the overseer and fixed his eyes on him, frowning.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;What? A minister? What minister? Who gave orders?&amp;rdquo; he said in his shrill, harsh voice. &amp;ldquo;The road is not swept for the princess my daughter, but for a minister! For me, there are no ministers!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Your honor, I thought...&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;You thought!&amp;rdquo; shouted the prince, his words coming more and more rapidly and indistinctly. &amp;ldquo;You thought!... Rascals! Blackguards!... I&amp;rsquo;ll teach you to think!&amp;rdquo; and lifting his stick he swung it and would have hit Alpátych, the overseer, had not the latter instinctively avoided the blow. &amp;ldquo;Thought... Blackguards...&amp;rdquo; shouted the prince rapidly.</p>
    <p>But although Alpátych, frightened at his own temerity in avoiding the stroke, came up to the prince, bowing his bald head resignedly before him, or perhaps for that very reason, the prince, though he continued to shout: &amp;ldquo;Blackguards!... Throw the snow back on the road!&amp;rdquo; did not lift his stick again but hurried into the house.</p>
    <p>Before dinner, Princess Mary and Mademoiselle Bourienne, who knew that the prince was in a bad humor, stood awaiting him; Mademoiselle Bourienne with a radiant face that said: &amp;ldquo;I know nothing, I am the same as usual,&amp;rdquo; and Princess Mary pale, frightened, and with downcast eyes. What she found hardest to bear was to know that on such occasions she ought to behave like Mademoiselle Bourienne, but could not. She thought: &amp;ldquo;If I seem not to notice he will think that I do not sympathize with him; if I seem sad and out of spirits myself, he will say (as he has done before) that I&amp;rsquo;m in the dumps.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The prince looked at his daughter&amp;rsquo;s frightened face and snorted.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Fool... or dummy!&amp;rdquo; he muttered.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;And the other one is not here. They&amp;rsquo;ve been telling tales,&amp;rdquo; he thought&amp;mdash;referring to the little princess who was not in the dining room.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Where is the princess?&amp;rdquo; he asked. &amp;ldquo;Hiding?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;She is not very well,&amp;rdquo; answered Mademoiselle Bourienne with a bright smile, &amp;ldquo;so she won&amp;rsquo;t come down. It is natural in her state.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Hm! Hm!&amp;rdquo; muttered the prince, sitting down.</p>
    <p>His plate seemed to him not quite clean, and pointing to a spot he flung it away. Tíkhon caught it and handed it to a footman. The little princess was not unwell, but had such an overpowering fear of the prince that, hearing he was in a bad humor, she had decided not to appear.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I am afraid for the baby,&amp;rdquo; she said to Mademoiselle Bourienne: &amp;ldquo;Heaven knows what a fright might do.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>In general at Bald Hills the little princess lived in constant fear, and with a sense of antipathy to the old prince which she did not realize because the fear was so much the stronger feeling. The prince reciprocated this antipathy, but it was overpowered by his contempt for her. When the little princess had grown accustomed to life at Bald Hills, she took a special fancy to Mademoiselle Bourienne, spent whole days with her, asked her to sleep in her room, and often talked with her about the old prince and criticized him.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;So we are to have visitors, <i>mon prince?</i>&amp;rdquo; remarked Mademoiselle Bourienne, unfolding her white napkin with her rosy fingers. &amp;ldquo;His Excellency Prince Vasíli Kurágin and his son, I understand?&amp;rdquo; she said inquiringly.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Hm!&amp;mdash;his excellency is a puppy.... I got him his appointment in the service,&amp;rdquo; said the prince disdainfully. &amp;ldquo;Why his son is coming I don&amp;rsquo;t understand. Perhaps Princess Elizabeth and Princess Mary know. I don&amp;rsquo;t want him.&amp;rdquo; (He looked at his blushing daughter.) &amp;ldquo;Are you unwell today? Eh? Afraid of the &amp;lsquo;minister&amp;rsquo; as that idiot Alpátych called him this morning?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;No, <i>mon père</i>.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Though Mademoiselle Bourienne had been so unsuccessful in her choice of a subject, she did not stop talking, but chattered about the conservatories and the beauty of a flower that had just opened, and after the soup the prince became more genial.</p>
    <p>After dinner, he went to see his daughter-in-law. The little princess was sitting at a small table, chattering with Másha, her maid. She grew pale on seeing her father-in-law.</p>
    <p>She was much altered. She was now plain rather than pretty. Her cheeks had sunk, her lip was drawn up, and her eyes drawn down.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Yes, I feel a kind of oppression,&amp;rdquo; she said in reply to the prince&amp;rsquo;s question as to how she felt.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Do you want anything?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;No, <i>merci, mon père</i>.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well, all right, all right.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>He left the room and went to the waiting room where Alpátych stood with bowed head.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Has the snow been shoveled back?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Yes, your excellency. Forgive me for heaven&amp;rsquo;s sake... It was only my stupidity.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;All right, all right,&amp;rdquo; interrupted the prince, and laughing his unnatural way, he stretched out his hand for Alpátych to kiss, and then proceeded to his study.</p>
    <p>Prince Vasíli arrived that evening. He was met in the avenue by coachmen and footmen, who, with loud shouts, dragged his sleighs up to one of the lodges over the road purposely laden with snow.</p>
    <p>Prince Vasíli and Anatole had separate rooms assigned to them.</p>
    <p>Anatole, having taken off his overcoat, sat with arms akimbo before a table on a corner of which he smilingly and absent-mindedly fixed his large and handsome eyes. He regarded his whole life as a continual round of amusement which someone for some reason had to provide for him. And he looked on this visit to a churlish old man and a rich and ugly heiress in the same way. All this might, he thought, turn out very well and amusingly. &amp;ldquo;And why not marry her if she really has so much money? That never does any harm,&amp;rdquo; thought Anatole.</p>
    <p>He shaved and scented himself with the care and elegance which had become habitual to him and, his handsome head held high, entered his father&amp;rsquo;s room with the good-humored and victorious air natural to him. Prince Vasíli&amp;rsquo;s two valets were busy dressing him, and he looked round with much animation and cheerfully nodded to his son as the latter entered, as if to say: &amp;ldquo;Yes, that&amp;rsquo;s how I want you to look.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I say, Father, joking apart, is she very hideous?&amp;rdquo; Anatole asked, as if continuing a conversation the subject of which had often been mentioned during the journey.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Enough! What nonsense! Above all, try to be respectful and cautious with the old prince.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;If he starts a row I&amp;rsquo;ll go away,&amp;rdquo; said Prince Anatole. &amp;ldquo;I can&amp;rsquo;t bear those old men! Eh?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Remember, for you everything depends on this.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>In the meantime, not only was it known in the maidservants&amp;rsquo; rooms that the minister and his son had arrived, but the appearance of both had been minutely described. Princess Mary was sitting alone in her room, vainly trying to master her agitation.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Why did they write, why did Lise tell me about it? It can never happen!&amp;rdquo; she said, looking at herself in the glass. &amp;ldquo;How shall I enter the drawing room? Even if I like him I can&amp;rsquo;t now be myself with him.&amp;rdquo; The mere thought of her father&amp;rsquo;s look filled her with terror. The little princess and Mademoiselle Bourienne had already received from Másha, the lady&amp;rsquo;s maid, the necessary report of how handsome the minister&amp;rsquo;s son was, with his rosy cheeks and dark eyebrows, and with what difficulty the father had dragged his legs upstairs while the son had followed him like an eagle, three steps at a time. Having received this information, the little princess and Mademoiselle Bourienne, whose chattering voices had reached her from the corridor, went into Princess Mary&amp;rsquo;s room.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;You know they&amp;rsquo;ve come, Marie?&amp;rdquo; said the little princess, waddling in, and sinking heavily into an armchair.</p>
    <p>She was no longer in the loose gown she generally wore in the morning, but had on one of her best dresses. Her hair was carefully done and her face was animated, which, however, did not conceal its sunken and faded outlines. Dressed as she used to be in Petersburg society, it was still more noticeable how much plainer she had become. Some unobtrusive touch had been added to Mademoiselle Bourienne&amp;rsquo;s toilet which rendered her fresh and pretty face yet more attractive.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;What! Are you going to remain as you are, dear princess?&amp;rdquo; she began. &amp;ldquo;They&amp;rsquo;ll be announcing that the gentlemen are in the drawing room and we shall have to go down, and you have not smartened yourself up at all!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The little princess got up, rang for the maid, and hurriedly and merrily began to devise and carry out a plan of how Princess Mary should be dressed. Princess Mary&amp;rsquo;s self-esteem was wounded by the fact that the arrival of a suitor agitated her, and still more so by both her companions&amp;rsquo; not having the least conception that it could be otherwise. To tell them that she felt ashamed for herself and for them would be to betray her agitation, while to decline their offers to dress her would prolong their banter and insistence. She flushed, her beautiful eyes grew dim, red blotches came on her face, and it took on the unattractive martyrlike expression it so often wore, as she submitted herself to Mademoiselle Bourienne and Lise. Both these women <i>quite sincerely</i> tried to make her look pretty. She was so plain that neither of them could think of her as a rival, so they began dressing her with perfect sincerity, and with the naïve and firm conviction women have that dress can make a face pretty.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;No really, my dear, this dress is not pretty,&amp;rdquo; said Lise, looking sideways at Princess Mary from a little distance. &amp;ldquo;You have a maroon dress, have it fetched. Really! You know the fate of your whole life may be at stake. But this one is too light, it&amp;rsquo;s not becoming!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>It was not the dress, but the face and whole figure of Princess Mary that was not pretty, but neither Mademoiselle Bourienne nor the little princess felt this; they still thought that if a blue ribbon were placed in the hair, the hair combed up, and the blue scarf arranged lower on the best maroon dress, and so on, all would be well. They forgot that the frightened face and the figure could not be altered, and that however they might change the setting and adornment of that face, it would still remain piteous and plain. After two or three changes to which Princess Mary meekly submitted, just as her hair had been arranged on the top of her head (a style that quite altered and spoiled her looks) and she had put on a maroon dress with a pale-blue scarf, the little princess walked twice round her, now adjusting a fold of the dress with her little hand, now arranging the scarf and looking at her with her head bent first on one side and then on the other.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;No, it will not do,&amp;rdquo; she said decidedly, clasping her hands. &amp;ldquo;No, Mary, really this dress does not suit you. I prefer you in your little gray everyday dress. Now please, do it for my sake. Katie,&amp;rdquo; she said to the maid, &amp;ldquo;bring the princess her gray dress, and you&amp;rsquo;ll see, Mademoiselle Bourienne, how I shall arrange it,&amp;rdquo; she added, smiling with a foretaste of artistic pleasure.</p>
    <p>But when Katie brought the required dress, Princess Mary remained sitting motionless before the glass, looking at her face, and saw in the mirror her eyes full of tears and her mouth quivering, ready to burst into sobs.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Come, dear princess,&amp;rdquo; said Mademoiselle Bourienne, &amp;ldquo;just one more little effort.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The little princess, taking the dress from the maid, came up to Princess Mary.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well, now we&amp;rsquo;ll arrange something quite simple and becoming,&amp;rdquo; she said.</p>
    <p>The three voices, hers, Mademoiselle Bourienne&amp;rsquo;s, and Katie&amp;rsquo;s, who was laughing at something, mingled in a merry sound, like the chirping of birds.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;No, leave me alone,&amp;rdquo; said Princess Mary.</p>
    <p>Her voice sounded so serious and so sad that the chirping of the birds was silenced at once. They looked at the beautiful, large, thoughtful eyes full of tears and of thoughts, gazing shiningly and imploringly at them, and understood that it was useless and even cruel to insist.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;At least, change your coiffure,&amp;rdquo; said the little princess. &amp;ldquo;Didn&amp;rsquo;t I tell you,&amp;rdquo; she went on, turning reproachfully to Mademoiselle Bourienne, &amp;ldquo;Mary&amp;rsquo;s is a face which such a coiffure does not suit in the least. Not in the least! Please change it.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Leave me alone, please leave me alone! It is all quite the same to me,&amp;rdquo; answered a voice struggling with tears.</p>
    <p>Mademoiselle Bourienne and the little princess had to own to themselves that Princess Mary in this guise looked very plain, worse than usual, but it was too late. She was looking at them with an expression they both knew, an expression thoughtful and sad. This expression in Princess Mary did not frighten them (she never inspired fear in anyone), but they knew that when it appeared on her face, she became mute and was not to be shaken in her determination.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;You will change it, won&amp;rsquo;t you?&amp;rdquo; said Lise. And as Princess Mary gave no answer, she left the room.</p>
    <p>Princess Mary was left alone. She did not comply with Lise&amp;rsquo;s request, she not only left her hair as it was, but did not even look in her glass. Letting her arms fall helplessly, she sat with downcast eyes and pondered. A husband, a man, a strong dominant and strangely attractive being rose in her imagination, and carried her into a totally different happy world of his own. She fancied a child, <i>her own</i>&amp;mdash;such as she had seen the day before in the arms of her nurse&amp;rsquo;s daughter&amp;mdash;at her own breast, the husband standing by and gazing tenderly at her and the child. &amp;ldquo;But no, it is impossible, I am too ugly,&amp;rdquo; she thought.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Please come to tea. The prince will be out in a moment,&amp;rdquo; came the maid&amp;rsquo;s voice at the door.</p>
    <p>She roused herself, and felt appalled at what she had been thinking, and before going down she went into the room where the icons hung and, her eyes fixed on the dark face of a large icon of the Saviour lit by a lamp, she stood before it with folded hands for a few moments. A painful doubt filled her soul. Could the joy of love, of earthly love for a man, be for her? In her thoughts of marriage Princess Mary dreamed of happiness and of children, but her strongest, most deeply hidden longing was for earthly love. The more she tried to hide this feeling from others and even from herself, the stronger it grew. &amp;ldquo;O God,&amp;rdquo; she said, &amp;ldquo;how am I to stifle in my heart these temptations of the devil? How am I to renounce forever these vile fancies, so as peacefully to fulfill Thy will?&amp;rdquo; And scarcely had she put that question than God gave her the answer in her own heart. &amp;ldquo;Desire nothing for thyself, seek nothing, be not anxious or envious. Man&amp;rsquo;s future and thy own fate must remain hidden from thee, but live so that thou mayest be ready for anything. If it be God&amp;rsquo;s will to prove thee in the duties of marriage, be ready to fulfill His will.&amp;rdquo; With this consoling thought (but yet with a hope for the fulfillment of her forbidden earthly longing) Princess Mary sighed, and having crossed herself went down, thinking neither of her gown and coiffure nor of how she would go in nor of what she would say. What could all that matter in comparison with the will of God, without Whose care not a hair of man&amp;rsquo;s head can fall?</p>
    <h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
    <p>When Princess Mary came down, Prince Vasíli and his son were already in the drawing room, talking to the little princess and Mademoiselle Bourienne. When she entered with her heavy step, treading on her heels, the gentlemen and Mademoiselle Bourienne rose and the little princess, indicating her to the gentlemen, said: <i>&amp;ldquo;Voilà Marie!&amp;rdquo;</i> Princess Mary saw them all and saw them in detail. She saw Prince Vasíli&amp;rsquo;s face, serious for an instant at the sight of her, but immediately smiling again, and the little princess curiously noting the impression &amp;ldquo;Marie&amp;rdquo; produced on the visitors. And she saw Mademoiselle Bourienne, with her ribbon and pretty face, and her unusually animated look which was fixed on <i>him</i>, but <i>him</i> she could not see, she only saw something large, brilliant, and handsome moving toward her as she entered the room. Prince Vasíli approached first, and she kissed the bold forehead that bent over her hand and answered his question by saying that, on the contrary, she remembered him quite well. Then Anatole came up to her. She still could not see him. She only felt a soft hand taking hers firmly, and she touched with her lips a white forehead, over which was beautiful light-brown hair smelling of pomade. When she looked up at him she was struck by his beauty. Anatole stood with his right thumb under a button of his uniform, his chest expanded and his back drawn in, slightly swinging one foot, and, with his head a little bent, looked with beaming face at the princess without speaking and evidently not thinking about her at all. Anatole was not quick-witted, nor ready or eloquent in conversation, but he had the faculty, so invaluable in society, of composure and imperturbable self-possession. If a man lacking in self-confidence remains dumb on a first introduction and betrays a consciousness of the impropriety of such silence and an anxiety to find something to say, the effect is bad. But Anatole was dumb, swung his foot, and smilingly examined the princess&amp;rsquo; hair. It was evident that he could be silent in this way for a very long time. &amp;ldquo;If anyone finds this silence inconvenient, let him talk, but I don&amp;rsquo;t want to,&amp;rdquo; he seemed to say. Besides this, in his behavior to women Anatole had a manner which particularly inspires in them curiosity, awe, and even love&amp;mdash;a supercilious consciousness of his own superiority. It was as if he said to them: &amp;ldquo;I know you, I know you, but why should I bother about you? You&amp;rsquo;d be only too glad, of course.&amp;rdquo; Perhaps he did not really think this when he met women&amp;mdash;even probably he did not, for in general he thought very little&amp;mdash;but his looks and manner gave that impression. The princess felt this, and as if wishing to show him that she did not even dare expect to interest him, she turned to his father. The conversation was general and animated, thanks to Princess Lise&amp;rsquo;s voice and little downy lip that lifted over her white teeth. She met Prince Vasíli with that playful manner often employed by lively chatty people, and consisting in the assumption that between the person they so address and themselves there are some semi-private, long-established jokes and amusing reminiscences, though no such reminiscences really exist&amp;mdash;just as none existed in this case. Prince Vasíli readily adopted her tone and the little princess also drew Anatole, whom she hardly knew, into these amusing recollections of things that had never occurred. Mademoiselle Bourienne also shared them and even Princess Mary felt herself pleasantly made to share in these merry reminiscences.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Here at least we shall have the benefit of your company all to ourselves, dear prince,&amp;rdquo; said the little princess (of course, in French) to Prince Vasíli. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s not as at Annette&amp;rsquo;s * receptions where you always ran away; you remember <i>cette chère Annette!</i>&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <pre class="testable">* Anna Pávlovna.</pre>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Ah, but you won&amp;rsquo;t talk politics to me like Annette!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;And our little tea table?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Oh, yes!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Why is it you were never at Annette&amp;rsquo;s?&amp;rdquo; the little princess asked Anatole. &amp;ldquo;Ah, I know, I know,&amp;rdquo; she said with a sly glance, &amp;ldquo;your brother Hippolyte told me about your goings on. Oh!&amp;rdquo; and she shook her finger at him, &amp;ldquo;I have even heard of your doings in Paris!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;And didn&amp;rsquo;t Hippolyte tell you?&amp;rdquo; asked Prince Vasíli, turning to his son and seizing the little princess&amp;rsquo; arm as if she would have run away and he had just managed to catch her, &amp;ldquo;didn&amp;rsquo;t he tell you how he himself was pining for the dear princess, and how she showed him the door? Oh, she is a pearl among women, Princess,&amp;rdquo; he added, turning to Princess Mary.</p>
    <p>When Paris was mentioned, Mademoiselle Bourienne for her part seized the opportunity of joining in the general current of recollections.</p>
    <p>She took the liberty of inquiring whether it was long since Anatole had left Paris and how he had liked that city. Anatole answered the Frenchwoman very readily and, looking at her with a smile, talked to her about her native land. When he saw the pretty little Bourienne, Anatole came to the conclusion that he would not find Bald Hills dull either. &amp;ldquo;Not at all bad!&amp;rdquo; he thought, examining her, &amp;ldquo;not at all bad, that little companion! I hope she will bring her along with her when we&amp;rsquo;re married, <i>la petite est gentille.</i>&amp;rdquo; *</p>
    <pre class="testable">* The little one is charming.</pre>
    <p>The old prince dressed leisurely in his study, frowning and considering what he was to do. The coming of these visitors annoyed him. &amp;ldquo;What are Prince Vasíli and that son of his to me? Prince Vasíli is a shallow braggart and his son, no doubt, is a fine specimen,&amp;rdquo; he grumbled to himself. What angered him was that the coming of these visitors revived in his mind an unsettled question he always tried to stifle, one about which he always deceived himself. The question was whether he could ever bring himself to part from his daughter and give her to a husband. The prince never directly asked himself that question, knowing beforehand that he would have to answer it justly, and justice clashed not only with his feelings but with the very possibility of life. Life without Princess Mary, little as he seemed to value her, was unthinkable to him. &amp;ldquo;And why should she marry?&amp;rdquo; he thought. &amp;ldquo;To be unhappy for certain. There&amp;rsquo;s Lise, married to Andrew&amp;mdash;a better husband one would think could hardly be found nowadays&amp;mdash;but is she contented with her lot? And who would marry Marie for love? Plain and awkward! They&amp;rsquo;ll take her for her connections and wealth. Are there no women living unmarried, and even the happier for it?&amp;rdquo; So thought Prince Bolkónski while dressing, and yet the question he was always putting off demanded an immediate answer. Prince Vasíli had brought his son with the evident intention of proposing, and today or tomorrow he would probably ask for an answer. His birth and position in society were not bad. &amp;ldquo;Well, I&amp;rsquo;ve nothing against it,&amp;rdquo; the prince said to himself, &amp;ldquo;but he must be worthy of her. And that is what we shall see.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;That is what we shall see! That is what we shall see!&amp;rdquo; he added aloud.</p>
    <p>He entered the drawing room with his usual alert step, glancing rapidly round the company. He noticed the change in the little princess&amp;rsquo; dress, Mademoiselle Bourienne&amp;rsquo;s ribbon, Princess Mary&amp;rsquo;s unbecoming coiffure, Mademoiselle Bourienne&amp;rsquo;s and Anatole&amp;rsquo;s smiles, and the loneliness of his daughter amid the general conversation. &amp;ldquo;Got herself up like a fool!&amp;rdquo; he thought, looking irritably at her. &amp;ldquo;She is shameless, and he ignores her!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>He went straight up to Prince Vasíli.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well! How d&amp;rsquo;ye do? How d&amp;rsquo;ye do? Glad to see you!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Friendship laughs at distance,&amp;rdquo; began Prince Vasíli in his usual rapid, self-confident, familiar tone. &amp;ldquo;Here is my second son; please love and befriend him.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Prince Bolkónski surveyed Anatole.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Fine young fellow! Fine young fellow!&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;Well, come and kiss me,&amp;rdquo; and he offered his cheek.</p>
    <p>Anatole kissed the old man, and looked at him with curiosity and perfect composure, waiting for a display of the eccentricities his father had told him to expect.</p>
    <p>Prince Bolkónski sat down in his usual place in the corner of the sofa and, drawing up an armchair for Prince Vasíli, pointed to it and began questioning him about political affairs and news. He seemed to listen attentively to what Prince Vasíli said, but kept glancing at Princess Mary.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;And so they are writing from Potsdam already?&amp;rdquo; he said, repeating Prince Vasíli&amp;rsquo;s last words. Then rising, he suddenly went up to his daughter.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Is it for visitors you&amp;rsquo;ve got yourself up like that, eh?&amp;rdquo; said he. &amp;ldquo;Fine, very fine! You have done up your hair in this new way for the visitors, and before the visitors I tell you that in future you are never to dare to change your way of dress without my consent.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;It was my fault, <i>mon père</i>,&amp;rdquo; interceded the little princess, with a blush.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;You must do as you please,&amp;rdquo; said Prince Bolkónski, bowing to his daughter-in-law, &amp;ldquo;but she need not make a fool of herself, she&amp;rsquo;s plain enough as it is.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>And he sat down again, paying no more attention to his daughter, who was reduced to tears.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;On the contrary, that coiffure suits the princess very well,&amp;rdquo; said Prince Vasíli.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Now you, young prince, what&amp;rsquo;s your name?&amp;rdquo; said Prince Bolkónski, turning to Anatole, &amp;ldquo;come here, let us talk and get acquainted.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Now the fun begins,&amp;rdquo; thought Anatole, sitting down with a smile beside the old prince.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well, my dear boy, I hear you&amp;rsquo;ve been educated abroad, not taught to read and write by the deacon, like your father and me. Now tell me, my dear boy, are you serving in the Horse Guards?&amp;rdquo; asked the old man, scrutinizing Anatole closely and intently.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;No, I have been transferred to the line,&amp;rdquo; said Anatole, hardly able to restrain his laughter.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Ah! That&amp;rsquo;s a good thing. So, my dear boy, you wish to serve the Tsar and the country? It is wartime. Such a fine fellow must serve. Well, are you off to the front?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;No, Prince, our regiment has gone to the front, but I am attached... what is it I am attached to, Papa?&amp;rdquo; said Anatole, turning to his father with a laugh.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;A splendid soldier, splendid! &amp;lsquo;What am I attached to!&amp;rsquo; Ha, ha, ha!&amp;rdquo; laughed Prince Bolkónski, and Anatole laughed still louder. Suddenly Prince Bolkónski frowned.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;You may go,&amp;rdquo; he said to Anatole.</p>
    <p>Anatole returned smiling to the ladies.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;And so you&amp;rsquo;ve had him educated abroad, Prince Vasíli, haven&amp;rsquo;t you?&amp;rdquo; said the old prince to Prince Vasíli.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I have done my best for him, and I can assure you the education there is much better than ours.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Yes, everything is different nowadays, everything is changed. The lad&amp;rsquo;s a fine fellow, a fine fellow! Well, come with me now.&amp;rdquo; He took Prince Vasíli&amp;rsquo;s arm and led him to his study. As soon as they were alone together, Prince Vasíli announced his hopes and wishes to the old prince.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well, do you think I shall prevent her, that I can&amp;rsquo;t part from her?&amp;rdquo; said the old prince angrily. &amp;ldquo;What an idea! I&amp;rsquo;m ready for it tomorrow! Only let me tell you, I want to know my son-in-law better. You know my principles&amp;mdash;everything aboveboard! I will ask her tomorrow in your presence; if she is willing, then he can stay on. He can stay and I&amp;rsquo;ll see.&amp;rdquo; The old prince snorted. &amp;ldquo;Let her marry, it&amp;rsquo;s all the same to me!&amp;rdquo; he screamed in the same piercing tone as when parting from his son.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I will tell you frankly,&amp;rdquo; said Prince Vasíli in the tone of a crafty man convinced of the futility of being cunning with so keen-sighted a companion. &amp;ldquo;You know, you see right through people. Anatole is no genius, but he is an honest, goodhearted lad; an excellent son or kinsman.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;All right, all right, we&amp;rsquo;ll see!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>As always happens when women lead lonely lives for any length of time without male society, on Anatole&amp;rsquo;s appearance all the three women of Prince Bolkónski&amp;rsquo;s household felt that their life had not been real till then. Their powers of reasoning, feeling, and observing immediately increased tenfold, and their life, which seemed to have been passed in darkness, was suddenly lit up by a new brightness, full of significance.</p>
    <p>Princess Mary grew quite unconscious of her face and coiffure. The handsome open face of the man who might perhaps be her husband absorbed all her attention. He seemed to her kind, brave, determined, manly, and magnanimous. She felt convinced of that. Thousands of dreams of a future family life continually rose in her imagination. She drove them away and tried to conceal them.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;But am I not too cold with him?&amp;rdquo; thought the princess. &amp;ldquo;I try to be reserved because in the depth of my soul I feel too near to him already, but then he cannot know what I think of him and may imagine that I do not like him.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>And Princess Mary tried, but could not manage, to be cordial to her new guest. &amp;ldquo;Poor girl, she&amp;rsquo;s devilish ugly!&amp;rdquo; thought Anatole.</p>
    <p>Mademoiselle Bourienne, also roused to great excitement by Anatole&amp;rsquo;s arrival, thought in another way. Of course, she, a handsome young woman without any definite position, without relations or even a country, did not intend to devote her life to serving Prince Bolkónski, to reading aloud to him and being friends with Princess Mary. Mademoiselle Bourienne had long been waiting for a Russian prince who, able to appreciate at a glance her superiority to the plain, badly dressed, ungainly Russian princesses, would fall in love with her and carry her off; and here at last was a Russian prince. Mademoiselle Bourienne knew a story, heard from her aunt but finished in her own way, which she liked to repeat to herself. It was the story of a girl who had been seduced, and to whom her poor mother (<i>sa pauvre mère</i>) appeared, and reproached her for yielding to a man without being married. Mademoiselle Bourienne was often touched to tears as in imagination she told this story to <i>him</i>, her seducer. And now <i>he</i>, a real Russian prince, had appeared. He would carry her away and then <i>sa pauvre mère</i> would appear and he would marry her. So her future shaped itself in Mademoiselle Bourienne&amp;rsquo;s head at the very time she was talking to Anatole about Paris. It was not calculation that guided her (she did not even for a moment consider what she should do), but all this had long been familiar to her, and now that Anatole had appeared it just grouped itself around him and she wished and tried to please him as much as possible.</p>
    <p>The little princess, like an old war horse that hears the trumpet, unconsciously and quite forgetting her condition, prepared for the familiar gallop of coquetry, without any ulterior motive or any struggle, but with naïve and lighthearted gaiety.</p>
    <p>Although in female society Anatole usually assumed the role of a man tired of being run after by women, his vanity was flattered by the spectacle of his power over these three women. Besides that, he was beginning to feel for the pretty and provocative Mademoiselle Bourienne that passionate animal feeling which was apt to master him with great suddenness and prompt him to the coarsest and most reckless actions.</p>
    <p>After tea, the company went into the sitting room and Princess Mary was asked to play on the clavichord. Anatole, laughing and in high spirits, came and leaned on his elbows, facing her and beside Mademoiselle Bourienne. Princess Mary felt his look with a painfully joyous emotion. Her favorite sonata bore her into a most intimately poetic world and the look she felt upon her made that world still more poetic. But Anatole&amp;rsquo;s expression, though his eyes were fixed on her, referred not to her but to the movements of Mademoiselle Bourienne&amp;rsquo;s little foot, which he was then touching with his own under the clavichord. Mademoiselle Bourienne was also looking at Princess Mary, and in her lovely eyes there was a look of fearful joy and hope that was also new to the princess.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;How she loves me!&amp;rdquo; thought Princess Mary. &amp;ldquo;How happy I am now, and how happy I may be with such a friend and such a husband! Husband? Can it be possible?&amp;rdquo; she thought, not daring to look at his face, but still feeling his eyes gazing at her.</p>
    <p>In the evening, after supper, when all were about to retire, Anatole kissed Princess Mary&amp;rsquo;s hand. She did not know how she found the courage, but she looked straight into his handsome face as it came near to her shortsighted eyes. Turning from Princess Mary he went up and kissed Mademoiselle Bourienne&amp;rsquo;s hand. (This was not etiquette, but then he did everything so simply and with such assurance!) Mademoiselle Bourienne flushed, and gave the princess a frightened look.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;What delicacy!&amp;rdquo; thought the princess. &amp;ldquo;Is it possible that Amélie&amp;rdquo; (Mademoiselle Bourienne) &amp;ldquo;thinks I could be jealous of her, and not value her pure affection and devotion to me?&amp;rdquo; She went up to her and kissed her warmly. Anatole went up to kiss the little princess&amp;rsquo; hand.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;No! No! No! When your father writes to tell me that you are behaving well I will give you my hand to kiss. Not till then!&amp;rdquo; she said. And smilingly raising a finger at him, she left the room.</p>
    <h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
    <p>They all separated, but, except Anatole who fell asleep as soon as he got into bed, all kept awake a long time that night.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Is he really to be my husband, this stranger who is so kind&amp;mdash;yes, kind, that is the chief thing,&amp;rdquo; thought Princess Mary; and fear, which she had seldom experienced, came upon her. She feared to look round, it seemed to her that someone was there standing behind the screen in the dark corner. And this someone was <i>he</i>&amp;mdash;the devil&amp;mdash;and <i>he</i> was also this man with the white forehead, black eyebrows, and red lips.</p>
    <p>She rang for her maid and asked her to sleep in her room.</p>
    <p>Mademoiselle Bourienne walked up and down the conservatory for a long time that evening, vainly expecting someone, now smiling at someone, now working herself up to tears with the imaginary words of her <i>pauvre mère</i> rebuking her for her fall.</p>
    <p>The little princess grumbled to her maid that her bed was badly made. She could not lie either on her face or on her side. Every position was awkward and uncomfortable, and her burden oppressed her now more than ever because Anatole&amp;rsquo;s presence had vividly recalled to her the time when she was not like that and when everything was light and gay. She sat in an armchair in her dressing jacket and nightcap and Katie, sleepy and disheveled, beat and turned the heavy feather bed for the third time, muttering to herself.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I told you it was all lumps and holes!&amp;rdquo; the little princess repeated. &amp;ldquo;I should be glad enough to fall asleep, so it&amp;rsquo;s not my fault!&amp;rdquo; and her voice quivered like that of a child about to cry.</p>
    <p>The old prince did not sleep either. Tíkhon, half asleep, heard him pacing angrily about and snorting. The old prince felt as though he had been insulted through his daughter. The insult was the more pointed because it concerned not himself but another, his daughter, whom he loved more than himself. He kept telling himself that he would consider the whole matter and decide what was right and how he should act, but instead of that he only excited himself more and more.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;The first man that turns up&amp;mdash;she forgets her father and everything else, runs upstairs and does up her hair and wags her tail and is unlike herself! Glad to throw her father over! And she knew I should notice it. Fr... fr... fr! And don&amp;rsquo;t I see that that idiot had eyes only for Bourienne&amp;mdash;I shall have to get rid of her. And how is it she has not pride enough to see it? If she has no pride for herself she might at least have some for my sake! She must be shown that the blockhead thinks nothing of her and looks only at Bourienne. No, she has no pride... but I&amp;rsquo;ll let her see....&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The old prince knew that if he told his daughter she was making a mistake and that Anatole meant to flirt with Mademoiselle Bourienne, Princess Mary&amp;rsquo;s self-esteem would be wounded and his point (not to be parted from her) would be gained, so pacifying himself with this thought, he called Tíkhon and began to undress.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;What devil brought them here?&amp;rdquo; thought he, while Tíkhon was putting the nightshirt over his dried-up old body and gray-haired chest. &amp;ldquo;I never invited them. They came to disturb my life&amp;mdash;and there is not much of it left.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Devil take &amp;lsquo;em!&amp;rdquo; he muttered, while his head was still covered by the shirt.</p>
    <p>Tíkhon knew his master&amp;rsquo;s habit of sometimes thinking aloud, and therefore met with unaltered looks the angrily inquisitive expression of the face that emerged from the shirt.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Gone to bed?&amp;rdquo; asked the prince.</p>
    <p>Tíkhon, like all good valets, instinctively knew the direction of his master&amp;rsquo;s thoughts. He guessed that the question referred to Prince Vasíli and his son.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;They have gone to bed and put out their lights, your excellency.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;No good... no good...&amp;rdquo; said the prince rapidly, and thrusting his feet into his slippers and his arms into the sleeves of his dressing gown, he went to the couch on which he slept.</p>
    <p>Though no words had passed between Anatole and Mademoiselle Bourienne, they quite understood one another as to the first part of their romance, up to the appearance of the <i>pauvre mère</i>; they understood that they had much to say to one another in private and so they had been seeking an opportunity since morning to meet one another alone. When Princess Mary went to her father&amp;rsquo;s room at the usual hour, Mademoiselle Bourienne and Anatole met in the conservatory.</p>
    <p>Princess Mary went to the door of the study with special trepidation. It seemed to her that not only did everybody know that her fate would be decided that day, but that they also knew what she thought about it. She read this in Tíkhon&amp;rsquo;s face and in that of Prince Vasíli&amp;rsquo;s valet, who made her a low bow when she met him in the corridor carrying hot water.</p>
    <p>The old prince was very affectionate and careful in his treatment of his daughter that morning. Princess Mary well knew this painstaking expression of her father&amp;rsquo;s. His face wore that expression when his dry hands clenched with vexation at her not understanding a sum in arithmetic, when rising from his chair he would walk away from her, repeating in a low voice the same words several times over.</p>
    <p>He came to the point at once, treating her ceremoniously.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I have had a proposition made me concerning you,&amp;rdquo; he said with an unnatural smile. &amp;ldquo;I expect you have guessed that Prince Vasíli has not come and brought his pupil with him&amp;rdquo; (for some reason Prince Bolkónski referred to Anatole as a &amp;ldquo;pupil&amp;rdquo;) &amp;ldquo;for the sake of my beautiful eyes. Last night a proposition was made me on your account and, as you know my principles, I refer it to you.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;How am I to understand you, <i>mon père?</i>&amp;rdquo; said the princess, growing pale and then blushing.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;How understand me!&amp;rdquo; cried her father angrily. &amp;ldquo;Prince Vasíli finds you to his taste as a daughter-in-law and makes a proposal to you on his pupil&amp;rsquo;s behalf. That&amp;rsquo;s how it&amp;rsquo;s to be understood! &amp;lsquo;How understand it&amp;rsquo;!... And I ask you!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I do not know what you think, Father,&amp;rdquo; whispered the princess.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I? I? What of me? Leave me out of the question. I&amp;rsquo;m not going to get married. What about <i>you?</i> That&amp;rsquo;s what I want to know.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The princess saw that her father regarded the matter with disapproval, but at that moment the thought occurred to her that her fate would be decided now or never. She lowered her eyes so as not to see the gaze under which she felt that she could not think, but would only be able to submit from habit, and she said: &amp;ldquo;I wish only to do your will, but if I had to express my own desire...&amp;rdquo; She had no time to finish. The old prince interrupted her.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s admirable!&amp;rdquo; he shouted. &amp;ldquo;He will take you with your dowry and take Mademoiselle Bourienne into the bargain. She&amp;rsquo;ll be the wife, while you...&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The prince stopped. He saw the effect these words had produced on his daughter. She lowered her head and was ready to burst into tears.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Now then, now then, I&amp;rsquo;m only joking!&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;Remember this, Princess, I hold to the principle that a maiden has a full right to choose. I give you freedom. Only remember that your life&amp;rsquo;s happiness depends on your decision. Never mind me!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;But I do not know, Father!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s no need to talk! He receives his orders and will marry you or anybody; but you are free to choose.... Go to your room, think it over, and come back in an hour and tell me in his presence: yes or no. I know you will pray over it. Well, pray if you like, but you had better <i>think</i> it over. Go! Yes or no, yes or no, yes or no!&amp;rdquo; he still shouted when the princess, as if lost in a fog, had already staggered out of the study.</p>
    <p>Her fate was decided and happily decided. But what her father had said about Mademoiselle Bourienne was dreadful. It was untrue to be sure, but still it was terrible, and she could not help thinking of it. She was going straight on through the conservatory, neither seeing nor hearing anything, when suddenly the well-known whispering of Mademoiselle Bourienne aroused her. She raised her eyes, and two steps away saw Anatole embracing the Frenchwoman and whispering something to her. With a horrified expression on his handsome face, Anatole looked at Princess Mary, but did not at once take his arm from the waist of Mademoiselle Bourienne who had not yet seen her.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Who&amp;rsquo;s that? Why? Wait a moment!&amp;rdquo; Anatole&amp;rsquo;s face seemed to say. Princess Mary looked at them in silence. She could not understand it. At last Mademoiselle Bourienne gave a scream and ran away. Anatole bowed to Princess Mary with a gay smile, as if inviting her to join in a laugh at this strange incident, and then shrugging his shoulders went to the door that led to his own apartments.</p>
    <p>An hour later, Tíkhon came to call Princess Mary to the old prince; he added that Prince Vasíli was also there. When Tíkhon came to her Princess Mary was sitting on the sofa in her room, holding the weeping Mademoiselle Bourienne in her arms and gently stroking her hair. The princess&amp;rsquo; beautiful eyes with all their former calm radiance were looking with tender affection and pity at Mademoiselle Bourienne&amp;rsquo;s pretty face.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;No, Princess, I have lost your affection forever!&amp;rdquo; said Mademoiselle Bourienne.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Why? I love you more than ever,&amp;rdquo; said Princess Mary, &amp;ldquo;and I will try to do all I can for your happiness.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;But you despise me. You who are so pure can never understand being so carried away by passion. Oh, only my poor mother...&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I quite understand,&amp;rdquo; answered Princess Mary, with a sad smile. &amp;ldquo;Calm yourself, my dear. I will go to my father,&amp;rdquo; she said, and went out.</p>
    <p>Prince Vasíli, with one leg thrown high over the other and a snuffbox in his hand, was sitting there with a smile of deep emotion on his face, as if stirred to his heart&amp;rsquo;s core and himself regretting and laughing at his own sensibility, when Princess Mary entered. He hurriedly took a pinch of snuff.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Ah, my dear, my dear!&amp;rdquo; he began, rising and taking her by both hands. Then, sighing, he added: &amp;ldquo;My son&amp;rsquo;s fate is in your hands. Decide, my dear, good, gentle Marie, whom I have always loved as a daughter!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>He drew back and a real tear appeared in his eye.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Fr... fr...&amp;rdquo; snorted Prince Bolkónski. &amp;ldquo;The prince is making a proposition to you in his pupil&amp;rsquo;s&amp;mdash;I mean, his son&amp;rsquo;s&amp;mdash;name. Do you wish or not to be Prince Anatole Kurágin&amp;rsquo;s wife? Reply: yes or no,&amp;rdquo; he shouted, &amp;ldquo;and then I shall reserve the right to state my opinion also. Yes, my opinion, and only my opinion,&amp;rdquo; added Prince Bolkónski, turning to Prince Vasíli and answering his imploring look. &amp;ldquo;Yes, or no?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;My desire is never to leave you, Father, never to separate my life from yours. I don&amp;rsquo;t wish to marry,&amp;rdquo; she answered positively, glancing at Prince Vasíli and at her father with her beautiful eyes.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Humbug! Nonsense! Humbug, humbug, humbug!&amp;rdquo; cried Prince Bolkónski, frowning and taking his daughter&amp;rsquo;s hand; he did not kiss her, but only bending his forehead to hers just touched it, and pressed her hand so that she winced and uttered a cry.</p>
    <p>Prince Vasíli rose.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;My dear, I must tell you that this is a moment I shall never, never forget. But, my dear, will you not give us a little hope of touching this heart, so kind and generous? Say &amp;lsquo;perhaps&amp;rsquo;... The future is so long. Say &amp;lsquo;perhaps.&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Prince, what I have said is all there is in my heart. I thank you for the honor, but I shall never be your son&amp;rsquo;s wife.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well, so that&amp;rsquo;s finished, my dear fellow! I am very glad to have seen you. Very glad! Go back to your rooms, Princess. Go!&amp;rdquo; said the old prince. &amp;ldquo;Very, very glad to have seen you,&amp;rdquo; repeated he, embracing Prince Vasíli.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;My vocation is a different one,&amp;rdquo; thought Princess Mary. &amp;ldquo;My vocation is to be happy with another kind of happiness, the happiness of love and self-sacrifice. And cost what it may, I will arrange poor Amélie&amp;rsquo;s happiness, she loves him so passionately, and so passionately repents. I will do all I can to arrange the match between them. If he is not rich I will give her the means; I will ask my father and Andrew. I shall be so happy when she is his wife. She is so unfortunate, a stranger, alone, helpless! And, oh God, how passionately she must love him if she could so far forget herself! Perhaps I might have done the same!...&amp;rdquo; thought Princess Mary.</p>
    <h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
    <p>It was long since the Rostóvs had news of Nicholas. Not till midwinter was the count at last handed a letter addressed in his son&amp;rsquo;s handwriting. On receiving it, he ran on tiptoe to his study in alarm and haste, trying to escape notice, closed the door, and began to read the letter.</p>
    <p>Anna Mikháylovna, who always knew everything that passed in the house, on hearing of the arrival of the letter went softly into the room and found the count with it in his hand, sobbing and laughing at the same time.</p>
    <p>Anna Mikháylovna, though her circumstances had improved, was still living with the Rostóvs.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;My dear friend?&amp;rdquo; said she, in a tone of pathetic inquiry, prepared to sympathize in any way.</p>
    <p>The count sobbed yet more.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Nikólenka... a letter... wa... a... s... wounded... my darling boy... the countess... promoted to be an officer... thank God... How tell the little countess!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Anna Mikháylovna sat down beside him, with her own handkerchief wiped the tears from his eyes and from the letter, then having dried her own eyes she comforted the count, and decided that at dinner and till teatime she would prepare the countess, and after tea, with God&amp;rsquo;s help, would inform her.</p>
    <p>At dinner Anna Mikháylovna talked the whole time about the war news and about Nikólenka, twice asked when the last letter had been received from him, though she knew that already, and remarked that they might very likely be getting a letter from him that day. Each time that these hints began to make the countess anxious and she glanced uneasily at the count and at Anna Mikháylovna, the latter very adroitly turned the conversation to insignificant matters. Natásha, who, of the whole family, was the most gifted with a capacity to feel any shades of intonation, look, and expression, pricked up her ears from the beginning of the meal and was certain that there was some secret between her father and Anna Mikháylovna, that it had something to do with her brother, and that Anna Mikháylovna was preparing them for it. Bold as she was, Natásha, who knew how sensitive her mother was to anything relating to Nikólenka, did not venture to ask any questions at dinner, but she was too excited to eat anything and kept wriggling about on her chair regardless of her governess&amp;rsquo; remarks. After dinner, she rushed headlong after Anna Mikháylovna and, dashing at her, flung herself on her neck as soon as she overtook her in the sitting room.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Auntie, darling, do tell me what it is!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Nothing, my dear.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;No, dearest, sweet one, honey, I won&amp;rsquo;t give up&amp;mdash;I know you know something.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Anna Mikháylovna shook her head.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;You are a little slyboots,&amp;rdquo; she said.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;A letter from Nikólenka! I&amp;rsquo;m sure of it!&amp;rdquo; exclaimed Natásha, reading confirmation in Anna Mikháylovna&amp;rsquo;s face.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;But for God&amp;rsquo;s sake, be careful, you know how it may affect your mamma.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I will, I will, only tell me! You won&amp;rsquo;t? Then I will go and tell at once.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Anna Mikháylovna, in a few words, told her the contents of the letter, on condition that she should tell no one.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;No, on my true word of honor,&amp;rdquo; said Natásha, crossing herself, &amp;ldquo;I won&amp;rsquo;t tell anyone!&amp;rdquo; and she ran off at once to Sónya.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Nikólenka... wounded... a letter,&amp;rdquo; she announced in gleeful triumph.</p>
    <p><i>&amp;ldquo;Nicholas!&amp;rdquo;</i> was all Sónya said, instantly turning white.</p>
    <p>Natásha, seeing the impression the news of her brother&amp;rsquo;s wound produced on Sónya, felt for the first time the sorrowful side of the news.</p>
    <p>She rushed to Sónya, hugged her, and began to cry.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;A little wound, but he has been made an officer; he is well now, he wrote himself,&amp;rdquo; said she through her tears.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;There now! It&amp;rsquo;s true that all you women are crybabies,&amp;rdquo; remarked Pétya, pacing the room with large, resolute strides. &amp;ldquo;Now I&amp;rsquo;m very glad, very glad indeed, that my brother has distinguished himself so. You are all blubberers and understand nothing.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Natásha smiled through her tears.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;You haven&amp;rsquo;t read the letter?&amp;rdquo; asked Sónya.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;No, but she said that it was all over and that he&amp;rsquo;s now an officer.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Thank God!&amp;rdquo; said Sónya, crossing herself. &amp;ldquo;But perhaps she deceived you. Let us go to Mamma.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Pétya paced the room in silence for a time.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;If I&amp;rsquo;d been in Nikólenka&amp;rsquo;s place I would have killed even more of those Frenchmen,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;What nasty brutes they are! I&amp;rsquo;d have killed so many that there&amp;rsquo;d have been a heap of them.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Hold your tongue, Pétya, what a goose you are!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not a goose, but they are who cry about trifles,&amp;rdquo; said Pétya.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Do you remember him?&amp;rdquo; Natásha suddenly asked, after a moment&amp;rsquo;s silence.</p>
    <p>Sónya smiled.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Do I remember <i>Nicholas?</i>&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;No, Sónya, but do you remember so that you remember him perfectly, remember everything?&amp;rdquo; said Natásha, with an expressive gesture, evidently wishing to give her words a very definite meaning. &amp;ldquo;I remember Nikólenka too, I remember him well,&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;But I don&amp;rsquo;t remember Borís. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember him a bit.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;What! You don&amp;rsquo;t remember Borís?&amp;rdquo; asked Sónya in surprise.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s not that I don&amp;rsquo;t remember&amp;mdash;I know what he is like, but not as I remember Nikólenka. Him&amp;mdash;I just shut my eyes and remember, but Borís... No!&amp;rdquo; (She shut her eyes.) &amp;ldquo;No! there&amp;rsquo;s nothing at all.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Oh, Natásha!&amp;rdquo; said Sónya, looking ecstatically and earnestly at her friend as if she did not consider her worthy to hear what she meant to say and as if she were saying it to someone else, with whom joking was out of the question, &amp;ldquo;I am in love with your brother once for all and, whatever may happen to him or to me, shall never cease to love him as long as I live.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Natásha looked at Sónya with wondering and inquisitive eyes, and said nothing. She felt that Sónya was speaking the truth, that there was such love as Sónya was speaking of. But Natásha had not yet felt anything like it. She believed it could be, but did not understand it.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Shall you write to him?&amp;rdquo; she asked.</p>
    <p>Sónya became thoughtful. The question of how to write to <i>Nicholas</i>, and whether she ought to write, tormented her. Now that he was already an officer and a wounded hero, would it be right to remind him of herself and, as it might seem, of the obligations to her he had taken on himself?</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know. I think if he writes, I will write too,&amp;rdquo; she said, blushing.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;And you won&amp;rsquo;t feel ashamed to write to him?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Sónya smiled.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;No.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;And I should be ashamed to write to Borís. I&amp;rsquo;m not going to.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Why should you be ashamed?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well, I don&amp;rsquo;t know. It&amp;rsquo;s awkward and would make me ashamed.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;And I know why she&amp;rsquo;d be ashamed,&amp;rdquo; said Pétya, offended by Natásha&amp;rsquo;s previous remark. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s because she was in love with that fat one in spectacles&amp;rdquo; (that was how Pétya described his namesake, the new Count Bezúkhov) &amp;ldquo;and now she&amp;rsquo;s in love with that singer&amp;rdquo; (he meant Natásha&amp;rsquo;s Italian singing master), &amp;ldquo;that&amp;rsquo;s why she&amp;rsquo;s ashamed!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Pétya, you&amp;rsquo;re a stupid!&amp;rdquo; said Natásha.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Not more stupid than you, madam,&amp;rdquo; said the nine-year-old Pétya, with the air of an old brigadier.</p>
    <p>The countess had been prepared by Anna Mikháylovna&amp;rsquo;s hints at dinner. On retiring to her own room, she sat in an armchair, her eyes fixed on a miniature portrait of her son on the lid of a snuffbox, while the tears kept coming into her eyes. Anna Mikháylovna, with the letter, came on tiptoe to the countess&amp;rsquo; door and paused.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t come in,&amp;rdquo; she said to the old count who was following her. &amp;ldquo;Come later.&amp;rdquo; And she went in, closing the door behind her.</p>
    <p>The count put his ear to the keyhole and listened.</p>
    <p>At first he heard the sound of indifferent voices, then Anna Mikháylovna&amp;rsquo;s voice alone in a long speech, then a cry, then silence, then both voices together with glad intonations, and then footsteps. Anna Mikháylovna opened the door. Her face wore the proud expression of a surgeon who has just performed a difficult operation and admits the public to appreciate his skill.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;It is done!&amp;rdquo; she said to the count, pointing triumphantly to the countess, who sat holding in one hand the snuffbox with its portrait and in the other the letter, and pressing them alternately to her lips.</p>
    <p>When she saw the count, she stretched out her arms to him, embraced his bald head, over which she again looked at the letter and the portrait, and in order to press them again to her lips, she slightly pushed away the bald head. Véra, Natásha, Sónya, and Pétya now entered the room, and the reading of the letter began. After a brief description of the campaign and the two battles in which he had taken part, and his promotion, Nicholas said that he kissed his father&amp;rsquo;s and mother&amp;rsquo;s hands asking for their blessing, and that he kissed Véra, Natásha, and Pétya. Besides that, he sent greetings to Monsieur Schelling, Madame Schoss, and his old nurse, and asked them to kiss for him &amp;ldquo;dear Sónya, whom he loved and thought of just the same as ever.&amp;rdquo; When she heard this Sónya blushed so that tears came into her eyes and, unable to bear the looks turned upon her, ran away into the dancing hall, whirled round it at full speed with her dress puffed out like a balloon, and, flushed and smiling, plumped down on the floor. The countess was crying.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Why are you crying, Mamma?&amp;rdquo; asked Véra. &amp;ldquo;From all he says one should be glad and not cry.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>This was quite true, but the count, the countess, and Natásha looked at her reproachfully. &amp;ldquo;And who is it she takes after?&amp;rdquo; thought the countess.</p>
    <p>Nicholas&amp;rsquo; letter was read over hundreds of times, and those who were considered worthy to hear it had to come to the countess, for she did not let it out of her hands. The tutors came, and the nurses, and Dmítri, and several acquaintances, and the countess reread the letter each time with fresh pleasure and each time discovered in it fresh proofs of Nikólenka&amp;rsquo;s virtues. How strange, how extraordinary, how joyful it seemed, that her son, the scarcely perceptible motion of whose tiny limbs she had felt twenty years ago within her, that son about whom she used to have quarrels with the too indulgent count, that son who had first learned to say &amp;ldquo;pear&amp;rdquo; and then &amp;ldquo;granny,&amp;rdquo; that this son should now be away in a foreign land amid strange surroundings, a manly warrior doing some kind of man&amp;rsquo;s work of his own, without help or guidance. The universal experience of ages, showing that children do grow imperceptibly from the cradle to manhood, did not exist for the countess. Her son&amp;rsquo;s growth toward manhood, at each of its stages, had seemed as extraordinary to her as if there had never existed the millions of human beings who grew up in the same way. As twenty years before, it seemed impossible that the little creature who lived somewhere under her heart would ever cry, suck her breast, and begin to speak, so now she could not believe that that little creature could be this strong, brave man, this model son and officer that, judging by this letter, he now was.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;What a <i>style!</i> How charmingly he describes!&amp;rdquo; said she, reading the descriptive part of the letter. &amp;ldquo;And what a soul! Not a word about himself.... Not a word! About some Denísov or other, though he himself, I dare say, is braver than any of them. He says nothing about his sufferings. What a heart! How like him it is! And how he has remembered everybody! Not forgetting anyone. I always said when he was only so high&amp;mdash;I always said....&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>For more than a week preparations were being made, rough drafts of letters to Nicholas from all the household were written and copied out, while under the supervision of the countess and the solicitude of the count, money and all things necessary for the uniform and equipment of the newly commissioned officer were collected. Anna Mikháylovna, practical woman that she was, had even managed by favor with army authorities to secure advantageous means of communication for herself and her son. She had opportunities of sending her letters to the Grand Duke Constantine Pávlovich, who commanded the Guards. The Rostóvs supposed that <i>The Russian Guards, Abroad</i>, was quite a definite address, and that if a letter reached the Grand Duke in command of the Guards there was no reason why it should not reach the Pávlograd regiment, which was presumably somewhere in the same neighborhood. And so it was decided to send the letters and money by the Grand Duke&amp;rsquo;s courier to Borís and Borís was to forward them to Nicholas. The letters were from the old count, the countess, Pétya, Véra, Natásha, and Sónya, and finally there were six thousand rubles for his outfit and various other things the old count sent to his son.</p>
    <h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
    <p>On the twelfth of November, Kutúzov&amp;rsquo;s active army, in camp before Olmütz, was preparing to be reviewed next day by the two Emperors&amp;mdash;the Russian and the Austrian. The Guards, just arrived from Russia, spent the night ten miles from Olmütz and next morning were to come straight to the review, reaching the field at Olmütz by ten o&amp;rsquo;clock.</p>
    <p>That day Nicholas Rostóv received a letter from Borís, telling him that the Ismáylov regiment was quartered for the night ten miles from Olmütz and that he wanted to see him as he had a letter and money for him. Rostóv was particularly in need of money now that the troops, after their active service, were stationed near Olmütz and the camp swarmed with well-provisioned sutlers and Austrian Jews offering all sorts of tempting wares. The Pávlograds held feast after feast, celebrating awards they had received for the campaign, and made expeditions to Olmütz to visit a certain Caroline the Hungarian, who had recently opened a restaurant there with girls as waitresses. Rostóv, who had just celebrated his promotion to a cornetcy and bought Denísov&amp;rsquo;s horse, Bedouin, was in debt all round, to his comrades and the sutlers. On receiving Borís&amp;rsquo; letter he rode with a fellow officer to Olmütz, dined there, drank a bottle of wine, and then set off alone to the Guards&amp;rsquo; camp to find his old playmate. Rostóv had not yet had time to get his uniform. He had on a shabby cadet jacket, decorated with a soldier&amp;rsquo;s cross, equally shabby cadet&amp;rsquo;s riding breeches lined with worn leather, and an officer&amp;rsquo;s saber with a sword knot. The Don horse he was riding was one he had bought from a Cossack during the campaign, and he wore a crumpled hussar cap stuck jauntily back on one side of his head. As he rode up to the camp he thought how he would impress Borís and all his comrades of the Guards by his appearance&amp;mdash;that of a fighting hussar who had been under fire.</p>
    <p>The Guards had made their whole march as if on a pleasure trip, parading their cleanliness and discipline. They had come by easy stages, their knapsacks conveyed on carts, and the Austrian authorities had provided excellent dinners for the officers at every halting place. The regiments had entered and left the town with their bands playing, and by the Grand Duke&amp;rsquo;s orders the men had marched all the way in step (a practice on which the Guards prided themselves), the officers on foot and at their proper posts. Borís had been quartered, and had marched all the way, with Berg who was already in command of a company. Berg, who had obtained his captaincy during the campaign, had gained the confidence of his superiors by his promptitude and accuracy and had arranged his money matters very satisfactorily. Borís, during the campaign, had made the acquaintance of many persons who might prove useful to him, and by a letter of recommendation he had brought from Pierre had become acquainted with Prince Andrew Bolkónski, through whom he hoped to obtain a post on the commander in chief&amp;rsquo;s staff. Berg and Borís, having rested after yesterday&amp;rsquo;s march, were sitting, clean and neatly dressed, at a round table in the clean quarters allotted to them, playing chess. Berg held a smoking pipe between his knees. Borís, in the accurate way characteristic of him, was building a little pyramid of chessmen with his delicate white fingers while awaiting Berg&amp;rsquo;s move, and watched his opponent&amp;rsquo;s face, evidently thinking about the game as he always thought only of whatever he was engaged on.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well, how are you going to get out of that?&amp;rdquo; he remarked.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ll try to,&amp;rdquo; replied Berg, touching a pawn and then removing his hand.</p>
    <p>At that moment the door opened.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Here he is at last!&amp;rdquo; shouted Rostóv. &amp;ldquo;And Berg too! Oh, you <i>petisenfans, allay cushay dormir!</i>&amp;rdquo; he exclaimed, imitating his Russian nurse&amp;rsquo;s French, at which he and Borís used to laugh long ago.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Dear me, how you have changed!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Borís rose to meet Rostóv, but in doing so did not omit to steady and replace some chessmen that were falling. He was about to embrace his friend, but Nicholas avoided him. With that peculiar feeling of youth, that dread of beaten tracks, and wish to express itself in a manner different from that of its elders which is often insincere, Nicholas wished to do something special on meeting his friend. He wanted to pinch him, push him, do anything but kiss him&amp;mdash;a thing everybody did. But notwithstanding this, Borís embraced him in a quiet, friendly way and kissed him three times.</p>
    <p>They had not met for nearly half a year and, being at the age when young men take their first steps on life&amp;rsquo;s road, each saw immense changes in the other, quite a new reflection of the society in which they had taken those first steps. Both had changed greatly since they last met and both were in a hurry to show the changes that had taken place in them.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Oh, you damned dandies! Clean and fresh as if you&amp;rsquo;d been to a fete, not like us sinners of the line,&amp;rdquo; cried Rostóv, with martial swagger and with baritone notes in his voice, new to Borís, pointing to his own mud-bespattered breeches. The German landlady, hearing Rostóv&amp;rsquo;s loud voice, popped her head in at the door.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Eh, is she pretty?&amp;rdquo; he asked with a wink.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Why do you shout so? You&amp;rsquo;ll frighten them!&amp;rdquo; said Borís. &amp;ldquo;I did not expect you today,&amp;rdquo; he added. &amp;ldquo;I only sent you the note yesterday by Bolkónski&amp;mdash;an adjutant of Kutúzov&amp;rsquo;s, who&amp;rsquo;s a friend of mine. I did not think he would get it to you so quickly.... Well, how are you? Been under fire already?&amp;rdquo; asked Borís.</p>
    <p>Without answering, Rostóv shook the soldier&amp;rsquo;s Cross of St. George fastened to the cording of his uniform and, indicating a bandaged arm, glanced at Berg with a smile.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;As you see,&amp;rdquo; he said.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Indeed? Yes, yes!&amp;rdquo; said Borís, with a smile. &amp;ldquo;And we too have had a splendid march. You know, of course, that His Imperial Highness rode with our regiment all the time, so that we had every comfort and every advantage. What receptions we had in Poland! What dinners and balls! I can&amp;rsquo;t tell you. And the Tsarévich was very gracious to all our officers.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>And the two friends told each other of their doings, the one of his hussar revels and life in the fighting line, the other of the pleasures and advantages of service under members of the Imperial family.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Oh, you Guards!&amp;rdquo; said Rostóv. &amp;ldquo;I say, send for some wine.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Borís made a grimace.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;If you really want it,&amp;rdquo; said he.</p>
    <p>He went to his bed, drew a purse from under the clean pillow, and sent for wine.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Yes, and I have some money and a letter to give you,&amp;rdquo; he added.</p>
    <p>Rostóv took the letter and, throwing the money on the sofa, put both arms on the table and began to read. After reading a few lines, he glanced angrily at Berg, then, meeting his eyes, hid his face behind the letter.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well, they&amp;rsquo;ve sent you a tidy sum,&amp;rdquo; said Berg, eying the heavy purse that sank into the sofa. &amp;ldquo;As for us, Count, we get along on our pay. I can tell you for myself...&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I say, Berg, my dear fellow,&amp;rdquo; said Rostóv, &amp;ldquo;when you get a letter from home and meet one of your own people whom you want to talk everything over with, and I happen to be there, I&amp;rsquo;ll go at once, to be out of your way! Do go somewhere, anywhere... to the devil!&amp;rdquo; he exclaimed, and immediately seizing him by the shoulder and looking amiably into his face, evidently wishing to soften the rudeness of his words, he added, &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t be hurt, my dear fellow; you know I speak from my heart as to an old acquaintance.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Oh, don&amp;rsquo;t mention it, Count! I quite understand,&amp;rdquo; said Berg, getting up and speaking in a muffled and guttural voice.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Go across to our hosts: they invited you,&amp;rdquo; added Borís.</p>
    <p>Berg put on the cleanest of coats, without a spot or speck of dust, stood before a looking glass and brushed the hair on his temples upwards, in the way affected by the Emperor Alexander, and, having assured himself from the way Rostóv looked at it that his coat had been noticed, left the room with a pleasant smile.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Oh dear, what a beast I am!&amp;rdquo; muttered Rostóv, as he read the letter.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Why?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Oh, what a pig I am, not to have written and to have given them such a fright! Oh, what a pig I am!&amp;rdquo; he repeated, flushing suddenly. &amp;ldquo;Well, have you sent Gabriel for some wine? All right let&amp;rsquo;s have some!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>In the letter from his parents was enclosed a letter of recommendation to Bagratión which the old countess at Anna Mikháylovna&amp;rsquo;s advice had obtained through an acquaintance and sent to her son, asking him to take it to its destination and make use of it.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;What nonsense! Much I need it!&amp;rdquo; said Rostóv, throwing the letter under the table.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Why have you thrown that away?&amp;rdquo; asked Borís.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;It is some letter of recommendation... what the devil do I want it for!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Why &amp;lsquo;What the devil&amp;rsquo;?&amp;rdquo; said Borís, picking it up and reading the address. &amp;ldquo;This letter would be of great use to you.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I want nothing, and I won&amp;rsquo;t be anyone&amp;rsquo;s adjutant.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Why not?&amp;rdquo; inquired Borís.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s a lackey&amp;rsquo;s job!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;You are still the same dreamer, I see,&amp;rdquo; remarked Borís, shaking his head.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;And you&amp;rsquo;re still the same diplomatist! But that&amp;rsquo;s not the point... Come, how are you?&amp;rdquo; asked Rostóv.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well, as you see. So far everything&amp;rsquo;s all right, but I confess I should much like to be an adjutant and not remain at the front.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Why?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Because when once a man starts on military service, he should try to make as successful a career of it as possible.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Oh, that&amp;rsquo;s it!&amp;rdquo; said Rostóv, evidently thinking of something else.</p>
    <p>He looked intently and inquiringly into his friend&amp;rsquo;s eyes, evidently trying in vain to find the answer to some question.</p>
    <p>Old Gabriel brought in the wine.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Shouldn&amp;rsquo;t we now send for Berg?&amp;rdquo; asked Borís. &amp;ldquo;He would drink with you. I can&amp;rsquo;t.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well, send for him... and how do you get on with that German?&amp;rdquo; asked Rostóv, with a contemptuous smile.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;He is a very, very nice, honest, and pleasant fellow,&amp;rdquo; answered Borís.</p>
    <p>Again Rostóv looked intently into Borís&amp;rsquo; eyes and sighed. Berg returned, and over the bottle of wine conversation between the three officers became animated. The Guardsmen told Rostóv of their march and how they had been made much of in Russia, Poland, and abroad. They spoke of the sayings and doings of their commander, the Grand Duke, and told stories of his kindness and irascibility. Berg, as usual, kept silent when the subject did not relate to himself, but in connection with the stories of the Grand Duke&amp;rsquo;s quick temper he related with gusto how in Galicia he had managed to deal with the Grand Duke when the latter made a tour of the regiments and was annoyed at the irregularity of a movement. With a pleasant smile Berg related how the Grand Duke had ridden up to him in a violent passion, shouting: &amp;ldquo;Arnauts!&amp;rdquo; (&amp;ldquo;Arnauts&amp;rdquo; was the Tsarévich&amp;rsquo;s favorite expression when he was in a rage) and called for the company commander.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Would you believe it, Count, I was not at all alarmed, because I knew I was right. Without boasting, you know, I may say that I know the Army Orders by heart and know the Regulations as well as I do the Lord&amp;rsquo;s Prayer. So, Count, there never is any negligence in my company, and so my conscience was at ease. I came forward....&amp;rdquo; (Berg stood up and showed how he presented himself, with his hand to his cap, and really it would have been difficult for a face to express greater respect and self-complacency than his did.) &amp;ldquo;Well, he stormed at me, as the saying is, stormed and stormed and stormed! It was not a matter of life but rather of death, as the saying is. &amp;lsquo;Albanians!&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;devils!&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;To Siberia!&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo; said Berg with a sagacious smile. &amp;ldquo;I knew I was in the right so I kept silent; was not that best, Count?... &amp;lsquo;Hey, are you dumb?&amp;rsquo; he shouted. Still I remained silent. And what do you think, Count? The next day it was not even mentioned in the Orders of the Day. That&amp;rsquo;s what keeping one&amp;rsquo;s head means. That&amp;rsquo;s the way, Count,&amp;rdquo; said Berg, lighting his pipe and emitting rings of smoke.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Yes, that was fine,&amp;rdquo; said Rostóv, smiling.</p>
    <p>But Borís noticed that he was preparing to make fun of Berg, and skillfully changed the subject. He asked him to tell them how and where he got his wound. This pleased Rostóv and he began talking about it, and as he went on became more and more animated. He told them of his Schön Grabern affair, just as those who have taken part in a battle generally do describe it, that is, as they would like it to have been, as they have heard it described by others, and as sounds well, but not at all as it really was. Rostóv was a truthful young man and would on no account have told a deliberate lie. He began his story meaning to tell everything just as it happened, but imperceptibly, involuntarily, and inevitably he lapsed into falsehood. If he had told the truth to his hearers&amp;mdash;who like himself had often heard stories of attacks and had formed a definite idea of what an attack was and were expecting to hear just such a story&amp;mdash;they would either not have believed him or, still worse, would have thought that Rostóv was himself to blame since what generally happens to the narrators of cavalry attacks had not happened to him. He could not tell them simply that everyone went at a trot and that he fell off his horse and sprained his arm and then ran as hard as he could from a Frenchman into the wood. Besides, to tell everything as it really happened, it would have been necessary to make an effort of will to tell only what happened. It is very difficult to tell the truth, and young people are rarely capable of it. His hearers expected a story of how beside himself and all aflame with excitement, he had flown like a storm at the square, cut his way in, slashed right and left, how his saber had tasted flesh and he had fallen exhausted, and so on. And so he told them all that.</p>
    <p>In the middle of his story, just as he was saying: &amp;ldquo;You cannot imagine what a strange frenzy one experiences during an attack,&amp;rdquo; Prince Andrew, whom Borís was expecting, entered the room. Prince Andrew, who liked to help young men, was flattered by being asked for his assistance and being well disposed toward Borís, who had managed to please him the day before, he wished to do what the young man wanted. Having been sent with papers from Kutúzov to the Tsarévich, he looked in on Borís, hoping to find him alone. When he came in and saw an hussar of the line recounting his military exploits (Prince Andrew could not endure that sort of man), he gave Borís a pleasant smile, frowned as with half-closed eyes he looked at Rostóv, bowed slightly and wearily, and sat down languidly on the sofa: he felt it unpleasant to have dropped in on bad company. Rostóv flushed up on noticing this, but he did not care, this was a mere stranger. Glancing, however, at Borís, he saw that he too seemed ashamed of the hussar of the line.</p>
    <p>In spite of Prince Andrew&amp;rsquo;s disagreeable, ironical tone, in spite of the contempt with which Rostóv, from his <i>fighting</i> army point of view, regarded all these little adjutants on the staff of whom the newcomer was evidently one, Rostóv felt confused, blushed, and became silent. Borís inquired what news there might be on the staff, and what, without indiscretion, one might ask about our plans.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;We shall probably advance,&amp;rdquo; replied Bolkónski, evidently reluctant to say more in the presence of a stranger.</p>
    <p>Berg took the opportunity to ask, with great politeness, whether, as was rumored, the allowance of forage money to captains of companies would be doubled. To this Prince Andrew answered with a smile that he could give no opinion on such an important government order, and Berg laughed gaily.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;As to your business,&amp;rdquo; Prince Andrew continued, addressing Borís, &amp;ldquo;we will talk of it later&amp;rdquo; (and he looked round at Rostóv). &amp;ldquo;Come to me after the review and we will do what is possible.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>And, having glanced round the room, Prince Andrew turned to Rostóv, whose state of unconquerable childish embarrassment now changing to anger he did not condescend to notice, and said: &amp;ldquo;I think you were talking of the Schön Grabern affair? Were you there?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I was there,&amp;rdquo; said Rostóv angrily, as if intending to insult the aide-de-camp.</p>
    <p>Bolkónski noticed the hussar&amp;rsquo;s state of mind, and it amused him. With a slightly contemptuous smile, he said: &amp;ldquo;Yes, there are many stories now told about that affair!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Yes, stories!&amp;rdquo; repeated Rostóv loudly, looking with eyes suddenly grown furious, now at Borís, now at Bolkónski. &amp;ldquo;Yes, many stories! But our stories are the stories of men who have been under the enemy&amp;rsquo;s fire! <i>Our</i> stories have some weight, not like the stories of those fellows on the staff who get rewards without doing anything!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Of whom you imagine me to be one?&amp;rdquo; said Prince Andrew, with a quiet and particularly amiable smile.</p>
    <p>A strange feeling of exasperation and yet of respect for this man&amp;rsquo;s self-possession mingled at that moment in Rostóv&amp;rsquo;s soul.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I am not talking about you,&amp;rdquo; he said, &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know you and, frankly, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to. I am speaking of the staff in general.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;And I will tell you this,&amp;rdquo; Prince Andrew interrupted in a tone of quiet authority, &amp;ldquo;you wish to insult me, and I am ready to agree with you that it would be very easy to do so if you haven&amp;rsquo;t sufficient self-respect, but admit that the time and place are very badly chosen. In a day or two we shall all have to take part in a greater and more serious duel, and besides, Drubetskóy, who says he is an old friend of yours, is not at all to blame that my face has the misfortune to displease you. However,&amp;rdquo; he added rising, &amp;ldquo;you know my name and where to find me, but don&amp;rsquo;t forget that I do not regard either myself or you as having been at all insulted, and as a man older than you, my advice is to let the matter drop. Well then, on Friday after the review I shall expect you, Drubetskóy. <i>Au revoir!</i>&amp;rdquo; exclaimed Prince Andrew, and with a bow to them both he went out.</p>
    <p>Only when Prince Andrew was gone did Rostóv think of what he ought to have said. And he was still more angry at having omitted to say it. He ordered his horse at once and, coldly taking leave of Borís, rode home. Should he go to headquarters next day and challenge that affected adjutant, or really let the matter drop, was the question that worried him all the way. He thought angrily of the pleasure he would have at seeing the fright of that small and frail but proud man when covered by his pistol, and then he felt with surprise that of all the men he knew there was none he would so much like to have for a friend as that very adjutant whom he so hated.</p>
    <h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
    <p>The day after Rostóv had been to see Borís, a review was held of the Austrian and Russian troops, both those freshly arrived from Russia and those who had been campaigning under Kutúzov. The two Emperors, the Russian with his heir the Tsarévich, and the Austrian with the Archduke, inspected the allied army of eighty thousand men.</p>
    <p>From early morning the smart clean troops were on the move, forming up on the field before the fortress. Now thousands of feet and bayonets moved and halted at the officers&amp;rsquo; command, turned with banners flying, formed up at intervals, and wheeled round other similar masses of infantry in different uniforms; now was heard the rhythmic beat of hoofs and the jingling of showy cavalry in blue, red, and green braided uniforms, with smartly dressed bandsmen in front mounted on black, roan, or gray horses; then again, spreading out with the brazen clatter of the polished shining cannon that quivered on the gun carriages and with the smell of linstocks, came the artillery which crawled between the infantry and cavalry and took up its appointed position. Not only the generals in full parade uniforms, with their thin or thick waists drawn in to the utmost, their red necks squeezed into their stiff collars, and wearing scarves and all their decorations, not only the elegant, pomaded officers, but every soldier with his freshly washed and shaven face and his weapons clean and polished to the utmost, and every horse groomed till its coat shone like satin and every hair of its wetted mane lay smooth&amp;mdash;felt that no small matter was happening, but an important and solemn affair. Every general and every soldier was conscious of his own insignificance, aware of being but a drop in that ocean of men, and yet at the same time was conscious of his strength as a part of that enormous whole.</p>
    <p>From early morning strenuous activities and efforts had begun and by ten o&amp;rsquo;clock all had been brought into due order. The ranks were drawn up on the vast field. The whole army was extended in three lines: the cavalry in front, behind it the artillery, and behind that again the infantry.</p>
    <p>A space like a street was left between each two lines of troops. The three parts of that army were sharply distinguished: Kutúzov&amp;rsquo;s fighting army (with the Pávlograds on the right flank of the front); those recently arrived from Russia, both Guards and regiments of the line; and the Austrian troops. But they all stood in the same lines, under one command, and in a like order.</p>
    <p>Like wind over leaves ran an excited whisper: &amp;ldquo;They&amp;rsquo;re coming! They&amp;rsquo;re coming!&amp;rdquo; Alarmed voices were heard, and a stir of final preparation swept over all the troops.</p>
    <p>From the direction of Olmütz in front of them, a group was seen approaching. And at that moment, though the day was still, a light gust of wind blowing over the army slightly stirred the streamers on the lances and the unfolded standards fluttered against their staffs. It looked as if by that slight motion the army itself was expressing its joy at the approach of the Emperors. One voice was heard shouting: &amp;ldquo;Eyes front!&amp;rdquo; Then, like the crowing of cocks at sunrise, this was repeated by others from various sides and all became silent.</p>
    <p>In the deathlike stillness only the tramp of horses was heard. This was the Emperors&amp;rsquo; suites. The Emperors rode up to the flank, and the trumpets of the first cavalry regiment played the general march. It seemed as though not the trumpeters were playing, but as if the army itself, rejoicing at the Emperors&amp;rsquo; approach, had naturally burst into music. Amid these sounds, only the youthful kindly voice of the Emperor Alexander was clearly heard. He gave the words of greeting, and the first regiment roared &amp;ldquo;Hurrah!&amp;rdquo; so deafeningly, continuously, and joyfully that the men themselves were awed by their multitude and the immensity of the power they constituted.</p>
    <p>Rostóv, standing in the front lines of Kutúzov&amp;rsquo;s army which the Tsar approached first, experienced the same feeling as every other man in that army: a feeling of self-forgetfulness, a proud consciousness of might, and a passionate attraction to him who was the cause of this triumph.</p>
    <p>He felt that at a single word from that man all this vast mass (and he himself an insignificant atom in it) would go through fire and water, commit crime, die, or perform deeds of highest heroism, and so he could not but tremble and his heart stand still at the imminence of that word.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!&amp;rdquo; thundered from all sides, one regiment after another greeting the Tsar with the strains of the march, and then &amp;ldquo;Hurrah!&amp;rdquo;... Then the general march, and again &amp;ldquo;Hurrah! Hurrah!&amp;rdquo; growing ever stronger and fuller and merging into a deafening roar.</p>
    <p>Till the Tsar reached it, each regiment in its silence and immobility seemed like a lifeless body, but as soon as he came up it became alive, its thunder joining the roar of the whole line along which he had already passed. Through the terrible and deafening roar of those voices, amid the square masses of troops standing motionless as if turned to stone, hundreds of riders composing the suites moved carelessly but symmetrically and above all freely, and in front of them two men&amp;mdash;the Emperors. Upon them the undivided, tensely passionate attention of that whole mass of men was concentrated.</p>
    <p>The handsome young Emperor Alexander, in the uniform of the Horse Guards, wearing a cocked hat with its peaks front and back, with his pleasant face and resonant though not loud voice, attracted everyone&amp;rsquo;s attention.</p>
    <p>Rostóv was not far from the trumpeters, and with his keen sight had recognized the Tsar and watched his approach. When he was within twenty paces, and Nicholas could clearly distinguish every detail of his handsome, happy young face, he experienced a feeling of tenderness and ecstasy such as he had never before known. Every trait and every movement of the Tsar&amp;rsquo;s seemed to him enchanting.</p>
    <p>Stopping in front of the Pávlograds, the Tsar said something in French to the Austrian Emperor and smiled.</p>
    <p>Seeing that smile, Rostóv involuntarily smiled himself and felt a still stronger flow of love for his sovereign. He longed to show that love in some way and knowing that this was impossible was ready to cry. The Tsar called the colonel of the regiment and said a few words to him.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Oh God, what would happen to me if the Emperor spoke to me?&amp;rdquo; thought Rostóv. &amp;ldquo;I should die of happiness!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The Tsar addressed the officers also: &amp;ldquo;I thank you all, gentlemen, I thank you with my whole heart.&amp;rdquo; To Rostóv every word sounded like a voice from heaven. How gladly would he have died at once for his Tsar!</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;You have earned the St. George&amp;rsquo;s standards and will be worthy of them.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Oh, to die, to die for him,&amp;rdquo; thought Rostóv.</p>
    <p>The Tsar said something more which Rostóv did not hear, and the soldiers, straining their lungs, shouted &amp;ldquo;Hurrah!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Rostóv too, bending over his saddle, shouted &amp;ldquo;Hurrah!&amp;rdquo; with all his might, feeling that he would like to injure himself by that shout, if only to express his rapture fully.</p>
    <p>The Tsar stopped a few minutes in front of the hussars as if undecided.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;How can the Emperor be undecided?&amp;rdquo; thought Rostóv, but then even this indecision appeared to him majestic and enchanting, like everything else the Tsar did.</p>
    <p>That hesitation lasted only an instant. The Tsar&amp;rsquo;s foot, in the narrow pointed boot then fashionable, touched the groin of the bobtailed bay mare he rode, his hand in a white glove gathered up the reins, and he moved off accompanied by an irregularly swaying sea of aides-de-camp. Farther and farther he rode away, stopping at other regiments, till at last only his white plumes were visible to Rostóv from amid the suites that surrounded the Emperors.</p>
    <p>Among the gentlemen of the suite, Rostóv noticed Bolkónski, sitting his horse indolently and carelessly. Rostóv recalled their quarrel of yesterday and the question presented itself whether he ought or ought not to challenge Bolkónski. &amp;ldquo;Of course not!&amp;rdquo; he now thought. &amp;ldquo;Is it worth thinking or speaking of it at such a moment? At a time of such love, such rapture, and such self-sacrifice, what do any of our quarrels and affronts matter? I love and forgive everybody now.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>When the Emperor had passed nearly all the regiments, the troops began a ceremonial march past him, and Rostóv on Bedouin, recently purchased from Denísov, rode past too, at the rear of his squadron&amp;mdash;that is, alone and in full view of the Emperor.</p>
    <p>Before he reached him, Rostóv, who was a splendid horseman, spurred Bedouin twice and successfully put him to the showy trot in which the animal went when excited. Bending his foaming muzzle to his chest, his tail extended, Bedouin, as if also conscious of the Emperor&amp;rsquo;s eye upon him, passed splendidly, lifting his feet with a high and graceful action, as if flying through the air without touching the ground.</p>
    <p>Rostóv himself, his legs well back and his stomach drawn in and feeling himself one with his horse, rode past the Emperor with a frowning but blissful face &amp;ldquo;like a vewy devil,&amp;rdquo; as Denísov expressed it.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Fine fellows, the Pávlograds!&amp;rdquo; remarked the Emperor.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;My God, how happy I should be if he ordered me to leap into the fire this instant!&amp;rdquo; thought Rostóv.</p>
    <p>When the review was over, the newly arrived officers, and also Kutúzov&amp;rsquo;s, collected in groups and began to talk about the awards, about the Austrians and their uniforms, about their lines, about Bonaparte, and how badly the latter would fare now, especially if the Essen corps arrived and Prussia took our side.</p>
    <p>But the talk in every group was chiefly about the Emperor Alexander. His every word and movement was described with ecstasy.</p>
    <p>They all had but one wish: to advance as soon as possible against the enemy under the Emperor&amp;rsquo;s command. Commanded by the Emperor himself they could not fail to vanquish anyone, be it whom it might: so thought Rostóv and most of the officers after the review.</p>
    <p>All were then more confident of victory than the winning of two battles would have made them.</p>
    <h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
    <p>The day after the review, Borís, in his best uniform and with his comrade Berg&amp;rsquo;s best wishes for success, rode to Olmütz to see Bolkónski, wishing to profit by his friendliness and obtain for himself the best post he could&amp;mdash;preferably that of adjutant to some important personage, a position in the army which seemed to him most attractive. &amp;ldquo;It is all very well for Rostóv, whose father sends him ten thousand rubles at a time, to talk about not wishing to cringe to anybody and not be anyone&amp;rsquo;s lackey, but I who have nothing but my brains have to make a career and must not miss opportunities, but must avail myself of them!&amp;rdquo; he reflected.</p>
    <p>He did not find Prince Andrew in Olmütz that day, but the appearance of the town where the headquarters and the diplomatic corps were stationed and the two Emperors were living with their suites, households, and courts only strengthened his desire to belong to that higher world.</p>
    <p>He knew no one, and despite his smart Guardsman&amp;rsquo;s uniform, all these exalted personages passing in the streets in their elegant carriages with their plumes, ribbons, and medals, both courtiers and military men, seemed so immeasurably above him, an insignificant officer of the Guards, that they not only did not wish to, but simply could not, be aware of his existence. At the quarters of the commander in chief, Kutúzov, where he inquired for Bolkónski, all the adjutants and even the orderlies looked at him as if they wished to impress on him that a great many officers like him were always coming there and that everybody was heartily sick of them. In spite of this, or rather because of it, next day, November 15, after dinner he again went to Olmütz and, entering the house occupied by Kutúzov, asked for Bolkónski. Prince Andrew was in and Borís was shown into a large hall probably formerly used for dancing, but in which five beds now stood, and furniture of various kinds: a table, chairs, and a clavichord. One adjutant, nearest the door, was sitting at the table in a Persian dressing gown, writing. Another, the red, stout Nesvítski, lay on a bed with his arms under his head, laughing with an officer who had sat down beside him. A third was playing a Viennese waltz on the clavichord, while a fourth, lying on the clavichord, sang the tune. Bolkónski was not there. None of these gentlemen changed his position on seeing Borís. The one who was writing and whom Borís addressed turned round crossly and told him Bolkónski was on duty and that he should go through the door on the left into the reception room if he wished to see him. Borís thanked him and went to the reception room, where he found some ten officers and generals.</p>
    <p>When he entered, Prince Andrew, his eyes drooping contemptuously (with that peculiar expression of polite weariness which plainly says, &amp;ldquo;If it were not my duty I would not talk to you for a moment&amp;rdquo;), was listening to an old Russian general with decorations, who stood very erect, almost on tiptoe, with a soldier&amp;rsquo;s obsequious expression on his purple face, reporting something.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Very well, then, be so good as to wait,&amp;rdquo; said Prince Andrew to the general, in Russian, speaking with the French intonation he affected when he wished to speak contemptuously, and noticing Borís, Prince Andrew, paying no more heed to the general who ran after him imploring him to hear something more, nodded and turned to him with a cheerful smile.</p>
    <p>At that moment Borís clearly realized what he had before surmised, that in the army, besides the subordination and discipline prescribed in the military code, which he and the others knew in the regiment, there was another, more important, subordination, which made this tight-laced, purple-faced general wait respectfully while Captain Prince Andrew, for his own pleasure, chose to chat with Lieutenant Drubetskóy. More than ever was Borís resolved to serve in future not according to the written code, but under this unwritten law. He felt now that merely by having been recommended to Prince Andrew he had already risen above the general who at the front had the power to annihilate him, a lieutenant of the Guards. Prince Andrew came up to him and took his hand.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I am very sorry you did not find me in yesterday. I was fussing about with Germans all day. We went with Weyrother to survey the dispositions. When Germans start being accurate, there&amp;rsquo;s no end to it!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Borís smiled, as if he understood what Prince Andrew was alluding to as something generally known. But it was the first time he had heard Weyrother&amp;rsquo;s name, or even the term &amp;ldquo;dispositions.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well, my dear fellow, so you still want to be an adjutant? I have been thinking about you.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Yes, I was thinking&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;for some reason Borís could not help blushing&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;of asking the commander in chief. He has had a letter from Prince Kurágin about me. I only wanted to ask because I fear the Guards won&amp;rsquo;t be in action,&amp;rdquo; he added as if in apology.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;All right, all right. We&amp;rsquo;ll talk it over,&amp;rdquo; replied Prince Andrew. &amp;ldquo;Only let me report this gentleman&amp;rsquo;s business, and I shall be at your disposal.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>While Prince Andrew went to report about the purple-faced general, that gentleman&amp;mdash;evidently not sharing Borís&amp;rsquo; conception of the advantages of the unwritten code of subordination&amp;mdash;looked so fixedly at the presumptuous lieutenant who had prevented his finishing what he had to say to the adjutant that Borís felt uncomfortable. He turned away and waited impatiently for Prince Andrew&amp;rsquo;s return from the commander in chief&amp;rsquo;s room.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;You see, my dear fellow, I have been thinking about you,&amp;rdquo; said Prince Andrew when they had gone into the large room where the clavichord was. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s no use your going to the commander in chief. He would say a lot of pleasant things, ask you to dinner&amp;rdquo; (&amp;ldquo;That would not be bad as regards the unwritten code,&amp;rdquo; thought Borís), &amp;ldquo;but nothing more would come of it. There will soon be a battalion of us aides-de-camp and adjutants! But this is what we&amp;rsquo;ll do: I have a good friend, an adjutant general and an excellent fellow, Prince Dolgorúkov; and though you may not know it, the fact is that now Kutúzov with his staff and all of us count for nothing. Everything is now centered round the Emperor. So we will go to Dolgorúkov; I have to go there anyhow and I have already spoken to him about you. We shall see whether he cannot attach you to himself or find a place for you somewhere nearer the sun.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Prince Andrew always became specially keen when he had to guide a young man and help him to worldly success. Under cover of obtaining help of this kind for another, which from pride he would never accept for himself, he kept in touch with the circle which confers success and which attracted him. He very readily took up Borís&amp;rsquo; cause and went with him to Dolgorúkov.</p>
    <p>It was late in the evening when they entered the palace at Olmütz occupied by the Emperors and their retinues.</p>
    <p>That same day a council of war had been held in which all the members of the Hofkriegsrath and both Emperors took part. At that council, contrary to the views of the old generals Kutúzov and Prince Schwartzenberg, it had been decided to advance immediately and give battle to Bonaparte. The council of war was just over when Prince Andrew accompanied by Borís arrived at the palace to find Dolgorúkov. Everyone at headquarters was still under the spell of the day&amp;rsquo;s council, at which the party of the young had triumphed. The voices of those who counseled delay and advised waiting for something else before advancing had been so completely silenced and their arguments confuted by such conclusive evidence of the advantages of attacking that what had been discussed at the council&amp;mdash;the coming battle and the victory that would certainly result from it&amp;mdash;no longer seemed to be in the future but in the past. All the advantages were on our side. Our enormous forces, undoubtedly superior to Napoleon&amp;rsquo;s, were concentrated in one place, the troops inspired by the Emperors&amp;rsquo; presence were eager for action. The strategic position where the operations would take place was familiar in all its details to the Austrian General Weyrother: a lucky accident had ordained that the Austrian army should maneuver the previous year on the very fields where the French had now to be fought; the adjacent locality was known and shown in every detail on the maps, and Bonaparte, evidently weakened, was undertaking nothing.</p>
    <p>Dolgorúkov, one of the warmest advocates of an attack, had just returned from the council, tired and exhausted but eager and proud of the victory that had been gained. Prince Andrew introduced his protégé, but Prince Dolgorúkov politely and firmly pressing his hand said nothing to Borís and, evidently unable to suppress the thoughts which were uppermost in his mind at that moment, addressed Prince Andrew in French.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Ah, my dear fellow, what a battle we have gained! God grant that the one that will result from it will be as victorious! However, dear fellow,&amp;rdquo; he said abruptly and eagerly, &amp;ldquo;I must confess to having been unjust to the Austrians and especially to Weyrother. What exactitude, what minuteness, what knowledge of the locality, what foresight for every eventuality, every possibility even to the smallest detail! No, my dear fellow, no conditions better than our present ones could have been devised. This combination of Austrian precision with Russian valor&amp;mdash;what more could be wished for?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;So the attack is definitely resolved on?&amp;rdquo; asked Bolkónski.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;And do you know, my dear fellow, it seems to me that Bonaparte has decidedly lost bearings, you know that a letter was received from him today for the Emperor.&amp;rdquo; Dolgorúkov smiled significantly.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Is that so? And what did he say?&amp;rdquo; inquired Bolkónski.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;What can he say? Tra-di-ri-di-ra and so on... merely to gain time. I tell you he is in our hands, that&amp;rsquo;s certain! But what was most amusing,&amp;rdquo; he continued, with a sudden, good-natured laugh, &amp;ldquo;was that we could not think how to address the reply! If not as &amp;lsquo;Consul&amp;rsquo; and of course not as &amp;lsquo;Emperor,&amp;rsquo; it seemed to me it should be to &amp;lsquo;General Bonaparte.&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;But between not recognizing him as Emperor and calling him General Bonaparte, there is a difference,&amp;rdquo; remarked Bolkónski.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s just it,&amp;rdquo; interrupted Dolgorúkov quickly, laughing. &amp;ldquo;You know Bilíbin&amp;mdash;he&amp;rsquo;s a very clever fellow. He suggested addressing him as &amp;lsquo;Usurper and Enemy of Mankind.&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Dolgorúkov laughed merrily.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Only that?&amp;rdquo; said Bolkónski.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;All the same, it was Bilíbin who found a suitable form for the address. He is a wise and clever fellow.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;What was it?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;To the Head of the French Government... <i>Au chef du gouvernement français</i>,&amp;rdquo; said Dolgorúkov, with grave satisfaction. &amp;ldquo;Good, wasn&amp;rsquo;t it?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Yes, but he will dislike it extremely,&amp;rdquo; said Bolkónski.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Oh yes, very much! My brother knows him, he&amp;rsquo;s dined with him&amp;mdash;the present Emperor&amp;mdash;more than once in Paris, and tells me he never met a more cunning or subtle diplomatist&amp;mdash;you know, a combination of French adroitness and Italian play-acting! Do you know the tale about him and Count Markóv? Count Markóv was the only man who knew how to handle him. You know the story of the handkerchief? It is delightful!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>And the talkative Dolgorúkov, turning now to Borís, now to Prince Andrew, told how Bonaparte wishing to test Markóv, our ambassador, purposely dropped a handkerchief in front of him and stood looking at Markóv, probably expecting Markóv to pick it up for him, and how Markóv immediately dropped his own beside it and picked it up without touching Bonaparte&amp;rsquo;s.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Delightful!&amp;rdquo; said Bolkónski. &amp;ldquo;But I have come to you, Prince, as a petitioner on behalf of this young man. You see...&amp;rdquo; but before Prince Andrew could finish, an aide-de-camp came in to summon Dolgorúkov to the Emperor.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Oh, what a nuisance,&amp;rdquo; said Dolgorúkov, getting up hurriedly and pressing the hands of Prince Andrew and Borís. &amp;ldquo;You know I should be very glad to do all in my power both for you and for this dear young man.&amp;rdquo; Again he pressed the hand of the latter with an expression of good-natured, sincere, and animated levity. &amp;ldquo;But you see... another time!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Borís was excited by the thought of being so close to the higher powers as he felt himself to be at that moment. He was conscious that here he was in contact with the springs that set in motion the enormous movements of the mass of which in his regiment he felt himself a tiny, obedient, and insignificant atom. They followed Prince Dolgorúkov out into the corridor and met&amp;mdash;coming out of the door of the Emperor&amp;rsquo;s room by which Dolgorúkov had entered&amp;mdash;a short man in civilian clothes with a clever face and sharply projecting jaw which, without spoiling his face, gave him a peculiar vivacity and shiftiness of expression. This short man nodded to Dolgorúkov as to an intimate friend and stared at Prince Andrew with cool intensity, walking straight toward him and evidently expecting him to bow or to step out of his way. Prince Andrew did neither: a look of animosity appeared on his face and the other turned away and went down the side of the corridor.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Who was that?&amp;rdquo; asked Borís.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;He is one of the most remarkable, but to me most unpleasant of men&amp;mdash;the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Prince Adam Czartorýski.... It is such men as he who decide the fate of nations,&amp;rdquo; added Bolkónski with a sigh he could not suppress, as they passed out of the palace.</p>
    <p>Next day, the army began its campaign, and up to the very battle of Austerlitz, Borís was unable to see either Prince Andrew or Dolgorúkov again and remained for a while with the Ismáylov regiment.</p>
    <h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
    <p>At dawn on the sixteenth of November, Denísov&amp;rsquo;s squadron, in which Nicholas Rostóv served and which was in Prince Bagratión&amp;rsquo;s detachment, moved from the place where it had spent the night, advancing into action as arranged, and after going behind other columns for about two thirds of a mile was stopped on the highroad. Rostóv saw the Cossacks and then the first and second squadrons of hussars and infantry battalions and artillery pass by and go forward and then Generals Bagratión and Dolgorúkov ride past with their adjutants. All the fear before action which he had experienced as previously, all the inner struggle to conquer that fear, all his dreams of distinguishing himself as a true hussar in this battle, had been wasted. Their squadron remained in reserve and Nicholas Rostóv spent that day in a dull and wretched mood. At nine in the morning, he heard firing in front and shouts of <i>hurrah</i>, and saw wounded being brought back (there were not many of them), and at last he saw how a whole detachment of French cavalry was brought in, convoyed by a <i>sótnya</i> of Cossacks. Evidently the affair was over and, though not big, had been a successful engagement. The men and officers returning spoke of a brilliant victory, of the occupation of the town of Wischau and the capture of a whole French squadron. The day was bright and sunny after a sharp night frost, and the cheerful glitter of that autumn day was in keeping with the news of victory which was conveyed, not only by the tales of those who had taken part in it, but also by the joyful expression on the faces of soldiers, officers, generals, and adjutants, as they passed Rostóv going or coming. And Nicholas, who had vainly suffered all the dread that precedes a battle and had spent that happy day in inactivity, was all the more depressed.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Come here, Wostóv. Let&amp;rsquo;s dwink to dwown our gwief!&amp;rdquo; shouted Denísov, who had settled down by the roadside with a flask and some food.</p>
    <p>The officers gathered round Denísov&amp;rsquo;s canteen, eating and talking.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;There! They are bringing another!&amp;rdquo; cried one of the officers, indicating a captive French dragoon who was being brought in on foot by two Cossacks.</p>
    <p>One of them was leading by the bridle a fine large French horse he had taken from the prisoner.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Sell us that horse!&amp;rdquo; Denísov called out to the Cossacks.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;If you like, your honor!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The officers got up and stood round the Cossacks and their prisoner. The French dragoon was a young Alsatian who spoke French with a German accent. He was breathless with agitation, his face was red, and when he heard some French spoken he at once began speaking to the officers, addressing first one, then another. He said he would not have been taken, it was not his fault but the corporal&amp;rsquo;s who had sent him to seize some horsecloths, though he had told him the Russians were there. And at every word he added: &amp;ldquo;But don&amp;rsquo;t hurt my little horse!&amp;rdquo; and stroked the animal. It was plain that he did not quite grasp where he was. Now he excused himself for having been taken prisoner and now, imagining himself before his own officers, insisted on his soldierly discipline and zeal in the service. He brought with him into our rearguard all the freshness of atmosphere of the French army, which was so alien to us.</p>
    <p>The Cossacks sold the horse for two gold pieces, and Rostóv, being the richest of the officers now that he had received his money, bought it.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;But don&amp;rsquo;t hurt my little horse!&amp;rdquo; said the Alsatian good-naturedly to Rostóv when the animal was handed over to the hussar.</p>
    <p>Rostóv smilingly reassured the dragoon and gave him money.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Alley! Alley!&amp;rdquo; said the Cossack, touching the prisoner&amp;rsquo;s arm to make him go on.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;The Emperor! The Emperor!&amp;rdquo; was suddenly heard among the hussars.</p>
    <p>All began to run and bustle, and Rostóv saw coming up the road behind him several riders with white plumes in their hats. In a moment everyone was in his place, waiting.</p>
    <p>Rostóv did not know or remember how he ran to his place and mounted. Instantly his regret at not having been in action and his dejected mood amid people of whom he was weary had gone, instantly every thought of himself had vanished. He was filled with happiness at his nearness to the Emperor. He felt that this nearness by itself made up to him for the day he had lost. He was happy as a lover when the longed-for moment of meeting arrives. Not daring to look round and without looking round, he was ecstatically conscious of <i>his</i> approach. He felt it not only from the sound of the hoofs of the approaching cavalcade, but because as <i>he</i> drew near everything grew brighter, more joyful, more significant, and more festive around him. Nearer and nearer to Rostóv came that sun shedding beams of mild and majestic light around, and already he felt himself enveloped in those beams, he heard <i>his</i> voice, that kindly, calm, and majestic voice that was yet so simple! And as if in accord with Rostóv&amp;rsquo;s feeling, there was a deathly stillness amid which was heard the Emperor&amp;rsquo;s voice.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;The Pávlograd hussars?&amp;rdquo; he inquired.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;The reserves, sire!&amp;rdquo; replied a voice, a very human one compared to that which had said: &amp;ldquo;The Pávlograd hussars?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The Emperor drew level with Rostóv and halted. Alexander&amp;rsquo;s face was even more beautiful than it had been three days before at the review. It shone with such gaiety and youth, such innocent youth, that it suggested the liveliness of a fourteen-year-old boy, and yet it was the face of the majestic Emperor. Casually, while surveying the squadron, the Emperor&amp;rsquo;s eyes met Rostóv&amp;rsquo;s and rested on them for not more than two seconds. Whether or no the Emperor understood what was going on in Rostóv&amp;rsquo;s soul (it seemed to Rostóv that he understood everything), at any rate his light-blue eyes gazed for about two seconds into Rostóv&amp;rsquo;s face. A gentle, mild light poured from them. Then all at once he raised his eyebrows, abruptly touched his horse with his left foot, and galloped on.</p>
    <p>The younger Emperor could not restrain his wish to be present at the battle and, in spite of the remonstrances of his courtiers, at twelve o&amp;rsquo;clock left the third column with which he had been and galloped toward the vanguard. Before he came up with the hussars, several adjutants met him with news of the successful result of the action.</p>
    <p>This battle, which consisted in the capture of a French squadron, was represented as a brilliant victory over the French, and so the Emperor and the whole army, especially while the smoke hung over the battlefield, believed that the French had been defeated and were retreating against their will. A few minutes after the Emperor had passed, the Pávlograd division was ordered to advance. In Wischau itself, a petty German town, Rostóv saw the Emperor again. In the market place, where there had been some rather heavy firing before the Emperor&amp;rsquo;s arrival, lay several killed and wounded soldiers whom there had not been time to move. The Emperor, surrounded by his suite of officers and courtiers, was riding a bobtailed chestnut mare, a different one from that which he had ridden at the review, and bending to one side he gracefully held a gold lorgnette to his eyes and looked at a soldier who lay prone, with blood on his uncovered head. The wounded soldier was so dirty, coarse, and revolting that his proximity to the Emperor shocked Rostóv. Rostóv saw how the Emperor&amp;rsquo;s rather round shoulders shuddered as if a cold shiver had run down them, how his left foot began convulsively tapping the horse&amp;rsquo;s side with the spur, and how the well-trained horse looked round unconcerned and did not stir. An adjutant, dismounting, lifted the soldier under the arms to place him on a stretcher that had been brought. The soldier groaned.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Gently, gently! Can&amp;rsquo;t you do it more gently?&amp;rdquo; said the Emperor apparently suffering more than the dying soldier, and he rode away.</p>
    <p>Rostóv saw tears filling the Emperor&amp;rsquo;s eyes and heard him, as he was riding away, say to Czartorýski: &amp;ldquo;What a terrible thing war is: what a terrible thing! <i>Quelle terrible chose que la guerre!</i>&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The troops of the vanguard were stationed before Wischau, within sight of the enemy&amp;rsquo;s lines, which all day long had yielded ground to us at the least firing. The Emperor&amp;rsquo;s gratitude was announced to the vanguard, rewards were promised, and the men received a double ration of vodka. The campfires crackled and the soldiers&amp;rsquo; songs resounded even more merrily than on the previous night. Denísov celebrated his promotion to the rank of major, and Rostóv, who had already drunk enough, at the end of the feast proposed the Emperor&amp;rsquo;s health. &amp;ldquo;Not &amp;lsquo;our Sovereign, the Emperor,&amp;rsquo; as they say at official dinners,&amp;rdquo; said he, &amp;ldquo;but the health of our Sovereign, that good, enchanting, and great man! Let us drink to his health and to the certain defeat of the French!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;If we fought before,&amp;rdquo; he said, &amp;ldquo;not letting the French pass, as at Schön Grabern, what shall we not do now when <i>he</i> is at the front? We will all die for him gladly! Is it not so, gentlemen? Perhaps I am not saying it right, I have drunk a good deal&amp;mdash;but that is how I feel, and so do you too! To the health of Alexander the First! Hurrah!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Hurrah!&amp;rdquo; rang the enthusiastic voices of the officers.</p>
    <p>And the old cavalry captain, Kírsten, shouted enthusiastically and no less sincerely than the twenty-year-old Rostóv.</p>
    <p>When the officers had emptied and smashed their glasses, Kírsten filled others and, in shirt sleeves and breeches, went glass in hand to the soldiers&amp;rsquo; bonfires and with his long gray mustache, his white chest showing under his open shirt, he stood in a majestic pose in the light of the campfire, waving his uplifted arm.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Lads! here&amp;rsquo;s to our Sovereign, the Emperor, and victory over our enemies! Hurrah!&amp;rdquo; he exclaimed in his dashing, old, hussar&amp;rsquo;s baritone.</p>
    <p>The hussars crowded round and responded heartily with loud shouts.</p>
    <p>Late that night, when all had separated, Denísov with his short hand patted his favorite, Rostóv, on the shoulder.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;As there&amp;rsquo;s no one to fall in love with on campaign, he&amp;rsquo;s fallen in love with the Tsar,&amp;rdquo; he said.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Denísov, don&amp;rsquo;t make fun of it!&amp;rdquo; cried Rostóv. &amp;ldquo;It is such a lofty, beautiful feeling, such a...&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I believe it, I believe it, fwiend, and I share and appwove...&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;No, you don&amp;rsquo;t understand!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>And Rostóv got up and went wandering among the campfires, dreaming of what happiness it would be to die&amp;mdash;not in saving the Emperor&amp;rsquo;s life (he did not even dare to dream of that), but simply to die before his eyes. He really was in love with the Tsar and the glory of the Russian arms and the hope of future triumph. And he was not the only man to experience that feeling during those memorable days preceding the battle of Austerlitz: nine tenths of the men in the Russian army were then in love, though less ecstatically, with their Tsar and the glory of the Russian arms.</p>
    <h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
    <p>The next day the Emperor stopped at Wischau, and Villier, his physician, was repeatedly summoned to see him. At headquarters and among the troops near by the news spread that the Emperor was unwell. He ate nothing and had slept badly that night, those around him reported. The cause of this indisposition was the strong impression made on his sensitive mind by the sight of the killed and wounded.</p>
    <p>At daybreak on the seventeenth, a French officer who had come with a flag of truce, demanding an audience with the Russian Emperor, was brought into Wischau from our outposts. This officer was Savary. The Emperor had only just fallen asleep and so Savary had to wait. At midday he was admitted to the Emperor, and an hour later he rode off with Prince Dolgorúkov to the advanced post of the French army.</p>
    <p>It was rumored that Savary had been sent to propose to Alexander a meeting with Napoleon. To the joy and pride of the whole army, a personal interview was refused, and instead of the Sovereign, Prince Dolgorúkov, the victor at Wischau, was sent with Savary to negotiate with Napoleon if, contrary to expectations, these negotiations were actuated by a real desire for peace.</p>
    <p>Toward evening Dolgorúkov came back, went straight to the Tsar, and remained alone with him for a long time.</p>
    <p>On the eighteenth and nineteenth of November, the army advanced two days&amp;rsquo; march and the enemy&amp;rsquo;s outposts after a brief interchange of shots retreated. In the highest army circles from midday on the nineteenth, a great, excitedly bustling activity began which lasted till the morning of the twentieth, when the memorable battle of Austerlitz was fought.</p>
    <p>Till midday on the nineteenth, the activity&amp;mdash;the eager talk, running to and fro, and dispatching of adjutants&amp;mdash;was confined to the Emperor&amp;rsquo;s headquarters. But on the afternoon of that day, this activity reached Kutúzov&amp;rsquo;s headquarters and the staffs of the commanders of columns. By evening, the adjutants had spread it to all ends and parts of the army, and in the night from the nineteenth to the twentieth, the whole eighty thousand allied troops rose from their bivouacs to the hum of voices, and the army swayed and started in one enormous mass six miles long.</p>
    <p>The concentrated activity which had begun at the Emperor&amp;rsquo;s headquarters in the morning and had started the whole movement that followed was like the first movement of the main wheel of a large tower clock. One wheel slowly moved, another was set in motion, and a third, and wheels began to revolve faster and faster, levers and cogwheels to work, chimes to play, figures to pop out, and the hands to advance with regular motion as a result of all that activity.</p>
    <p>Just as in the mechanism of a clock, so in the mechanism of the military machine, an impulse once given leads to the final result; and just as indifferently quiescent till the moment when motion is transmitted to them are the parts of the mechanism which the impulse has not yet reached. Wheels creak on their axles as the cogs engage one another and the revolving pulleys whirr with the rapidity of their movement, but a neighboring wheel is as quiet and motionless as though it were prepared to remain so for a hundred years; but the moment comes when the lever catches it and obeying the impulse that wheel begins to creak and joins in the common motion the result and aim of which are beyond its ken.</p>
    <p>Just as in a clock, the result of the complicated motion of innumerable wheels and pulleys is merely a slow and regular movement of the hands which show the time, so the result of all the complicated human activities of 160,000 Russians and French&amp;mdash;all their passions, desires, remorse, humiliations, sufferings, outbursts of pride, fear, and enthusiasm&amp;mdash;was only the loss of the battle of Austerlitz, the so-called battle of the three Emperors&amp;mdash;that is to say, a slow movement of the hand on the dial of human history.</p>
    <p>Prince Andrew was on duty that day and in constant attendance on the commander in chief.</p>
    <p>At six in the evening, Kutúzov went to the Emperor&amp;rsquo;s headquarters and after staying but a short time with the Tsar went to see the grand marshal of the court, Count Tolstóy.</p>
    <p>Bolkónski took the opportunity to go in to get some details of the coming action from Dolgorúkov. He felt that Kutúzov was upset and dissatisfied about something and that at headquarters they were dissatisfied with him, and also that at the Emperor&amp;rsquo;s headquarters everyone adopted toward him the tone of men who know something others do not know: he therefore wished to speak to Dolgorúkov.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well, how d&amp;rsquo;you do, my dear fellow?&amp;rdquo; said Dolgorúkov, who was sitting at tea with Bilíbin. &amp;ldquo;The fete is for tomorrow. How is your old fellow? Out of sorts?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I won&amp;rsquo;t say he is out of sorts, but I fancy he would like to be heard.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;But they heard him at the council of war and will hear him when he talks sense, but to temporize and wait for something now when Bonaparte fears nothing so much as a general battle is impossible.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Yes, you have seen him?&amp;rdquo; said Prince Andrew. &amp;ldquo;Well, what is Bonaparte like? How did he impress you?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Yes, I saw him, and am convinced that he fears nothing so much as a general engagement,&amp;rdquo; repeated Dolgorúkov, evidently prizing this general conclusion which he had arrived at from his interview with Napoleon. &amp;ldquo;If he weren&amp;rsquo;t afraid of a battle why did he ask for that interview? Why negotiate, and above all why retreat, when to retreat is so contrary to his method of conducting war? Believe me, he is afraid, afraid of a general battle. His hour has come! Mark my words!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;But tell me, what is he like, eh?&amp;rdquo; said Prince Andrew again.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;He is a man in a gray overcoat, very anxious that I should call him &amp;lsquo;Your Majesty,&amp;rsquo; but who, to his chagrin, got no title from me! That&amp;rsquo;s the sort of man he is, and nothing more,&amp;rdquo; replied Dolgorúkov, looking round at Bilíbin with a smile.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Despite my great respect for old Kutúzov,&amp;rdquo; he continued, &amp;ldquo;we should be a nice set of fellows if we were to wait about and so give him a chance to escape, or to trick us, now that we certainly have him in our hands! No, we mustn&amp;rsquo;t forget Suvórov and his rule&amp;mdash;not to put yourself in a position to be attacked, but yourself to attack. Believe me in war the energy of young men often shows the way better than all the experience of old Cunctators.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;But in what position are we going to attack him? I have been at the outposts today and it is impossible to say where his chief forces are situated,&amp;rdquo; said Prince Andrew.</p>
    <p>He wished to explain to Dolgorúkov a plan of attack he had himself formed.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Oh, that is all the same,&amp;rdquo; Dolgorúkov said quickly, and getting up he spread a map on the table. &amp;ldquo;All eventualities have been foreseen. If he is standing before Brünn...&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>And Prince Dolgorúkov rapidly but indistinctly explained Weyrother&amp;rsquo;s plan of a flanking movement.</p>
    <p>Prince Andrew began to reply and to state his own plan, which might have been as good as Weyrother&amp;rsquo;s, but for the disadvantage that Weyrother&amp;rsquo;s had already been approved. As soon as Prince Andrew began to demonstrate the defects of the latter and the merits of his own plan, Prince Dolgorúkov ceased to listen to him and gazed absent-mindedly not at the map, but at Prince Andrew&amp;rsquo;s face.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;There will be a council of war at Kutúzov&amp;rsquo;s tonight, though; you can say all this there,&amp;rdquo; remarked Dolgorúkov.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I will do so,&amp;rdquo; said Prince Andrew, moving away from the map.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Whatever are you bothering about, gentlemen?&amp;rdquo; said Bilíbin, who, till then, had listened with an amused smile to their conversation and now was evidently ready with a joke. &amp;ldquo;Whether tomorrow brings victory or defeat, the glory of our Russian arms is secure. Except your Kutúzov, there is not a single Russian in command of a column! The commanders are: Herr General Wimpfen, le Comte de Langeron, le Prince de Lichtenstein, le Prince, de Hohenlohe, and finally Prishprish, and so on like all those Polish names.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Be quiet, backbiter!&amp;rdquo; said Dolgorúkov. &amp;ldquo;It is not true; there are now two Russians, Milorádovich, and Dokhtúrov, and there would be a third, Count Arakchéev, if his nerves were not too weak.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;However, I think General Kutúzov has come out,&amp;rdquo; said Prince Andrew. &amp;ldquo;I wish you good luck and success, gentlemen!&amp;rdquo; he added and went out after shaking hands with Dolgorúkov and Bilíbin.</p>
    <p>On the way home, Prince Andrew could not refrain from asking Kutúzov, who was sitting silently beside him, what he thought of tomorrow&amp;rsquo;s battle.</p>
    <p>Kutúzov looked sternly at his adjutant and, after a pause, replied: &amp;ldquo;I think the battle will be lost, and so I told Count Tolstóy and asked him to tell the Emperor. What do you think he replied? &amp;lsquo;But, my dear general, I am engaged with rice and cutlets, look after military matters yourself!&amp;rsquo; Yes... That was the answer I got!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
    <p>Shortly after nine o&amp;rsquo;clock that evening, Weyrother drove with his plans to Kutúzov&amp;rsquo;s quarters where the council of war was to be held. All the commanders of columns were summoned to the commander in chief&amp;rsquo;s and with the exception of Prince Bagratión, who declined to come, were all there at the appointed time.</p>
    <p>Weyrother, who was in full control of the proposed battle, by his eagerness and briskness presented a marked contrast to the dissatisfied and drowsy Kutúzov, who reluctantly played the part of chairman and president of the council of war. Weyrother evidently felt himself to be at the head of a movement that had already become unrestrainable. He was like a horse running downhill harnessed to a heavy cart. Whether he was pulling it or being pushed by it he did not know, but rushed along at headlong speed with no time to consider what this movement might lead to. Weyrother had been twice that evening to the enemy&amp;rsquo;s picket line to reconnoiter personally, and twice to the Emperors, Russian and Austrian, to report and explain, and to his headquarters where he had dictated the dispositions in German, and now, much exhausted, he arrived at Kutúzov&amp;rsquo;s.</p>
    <p>He was evidently so busy that he even forgot to be polite to the commander in chief. He interrupted him, talked rapidly and indistinctly, without looking at the man he was addressing, and did not reply to questions put to him. He was bespattered with mud and had a pitiful, weary, and distracted air, though at the same time he was haughty and self-confident.</p>
    <p>Kutúzov was occupying a nobleman&amp;rsquo;s castle of modest dimensions near Ostralitz. In the large drawing room which had become the commander in chief&amp;rsquo;s office were gathered Kutúzov himself, Weyrother, and the members of the council of war. They were drinking tea, and only awaited Prince Bagratión to begin the council. At last Bagratión&amp;rsquo;s orderly came with the news that the prince could not attend. Prince Andrew came in to inform the commander in chief of this and, availing himself of permission previously given him by Kutúzov to be present at the council, he remained in the room.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Since Prince Bagratión is not coming, we may begin,&amp;rdquo; said Weyrother, hurriedly rising from his seat and going up to the table on which an enormous map of the environs of Brünn was spread out.</p>
    <p>Kutúzov, with his uniform unbuttoned so that his fat neck bulged over his collar as if escaping, was sitting almost asleep in a low chair, with his podgy old hands resting symmetrically on its arms. At the sound of Weyrother&amp;rsquo;s voice, he opened his one eye with an effort.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Yes, yes, if you please! It is already late,&amp;rdquo; said he, and nodding his head he let it droop and again closed his eye.</p>
    <p>If at first the members of the council thought that Kutúzov was pretending to sleep, the sounds his nose emitted during the reading that followed proved that the commander in chief at that moment was absorbed by a far more serious matter than a desire to show his contempt for the dispositions or anything else&amp;mdash;he was engaged in satisfying the irresistible human need for sleep. He really was asleep. Weyrother, with the gesture of a man too busy to lose a moment, glanced at Kutúzov and, having convinced himself that he was asleep, took up a paper and in a loud, monotonous voice began to read out the dispositions for the impending battle, under a heading which he also read out:</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Dispositions for an attack on the enemy position behind Kobelnitz and Sokolnitz, November 30, 1805.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The dispositions were very complicated and difficult. They began as follows:</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;As the enemy&amp;rsquo;s left wing rests on wooded hills and his right extends along Kobelnitz and Sokolnitz behind the ponds that are there, while we, on the other hand, with our left wing by far outflank his right, it is advantageous to attack the enemy&amp;rsquo;s latter wing especially if we occupy the villages of Sokolnitz and Kobelnitz, whereby we can both fall on his flank and pursue him over the plain between Schlappanitz and the Thuerassa forest, avoiding the defiles of Schlappanitz and Bellowitz which cover the enemy&amp;rsquo;s front. For this object it is necessary that... The first column marches... The second column marches... The third column marches...&amp;rdquo; and so on, read Weyrother.</p>
    <p>The generals seemed to listen reluctantly to the difficult dispositions. The tall, fair-haired General Buxhöwden stood, leaning his back against the wall, his eyes fixed on a burning candle, and seemed not to listen or even to wish to be thought to listen. Exactly opposite Weyrother, with his glistening wide-open eyes fixed upon him and his mustache twisted upwards, sat the ruddy Milorádovich in a military pose, his elbows turned outwards, his hands on his knees, and his shoulders raised. He remained stubbornly silent, gazing at Weyrother&amp;rsquo;s face, and only turned away his eyes when the Austrian chief of staff finished reading. Then Milorádovich looked round significantly at the other generals. But one could not tell from that significant look whether he agreed or disagreed and was satisfied or not with the arrangements. Next to Weyrother sat Count Langeron who, with a subtle smile that never left his typically southern French face during the whole time of the reading, gazed at his delicate fingers which rapidly twirled by its corners a gold snuffbox on which was a portrait. In the middle of one of the longest sentences, he stopped the rotary motion of the snuffbox, raised his head, and with inimical politeness lurking in the corners of his thin lips interrupted Weyrother, wishing to say something. But the Austrian general, continuing to read, frowned angrily and jerked his elbows, as if to say: &amp;ldquo;You can tell me your views later, but now be so good as to look at the map and listen.&amp;rdquo; Langeron lifted his eyes with an expression of perplexity, turned round to Milorádovich as if seeking an explanation, but meeting the latter&amp;rsquo;s impressive but meaningless gaze drooped his eyes sadly and again took to twirling his snuffbox.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;A geography lesson!&amp;rdquo; he muttered as if to himself, but loud enough to be heard.</p>
    <p>Przebyszéwski, with respectful but dignified politeness, held his hand to his ear toward Weyrother, with the air of a man absorbed in attention. Dohktúrov, a little man, sat opposite Weyrother, with an assiduous and modest mien, and stooping over the outspread map conscientiously studied the dispositions and the unfamiliar locality. He asked Weyrother several times to repeat words he had not clearly heard and the difficult names of villages. Weyrother complied and Dohktúrov noted them down.</p>
    <p>When the reading which lasted more than an hour was over, Langeron again brought his snuffbox to rest and, without looking at Weyrother or at anyone in particular, began to say how difficult it was to carry out such a plan in which the enemy&amp;rsquo;s position was assumed to be known, whereas it was perhaps not known, since the enemy was in movement. Langeron&amp;rsquo;s objections were valid but it was obvious that their chief aim was to show General Weyrother&amp;mdash;who had read his dispositions with as much self-confidence as if he were addressing school children&amp;mdash;that he had to do, not with fools, but with men who could teach him something in military matters.</p>
    <p>When the monotonous sound of Weyrother&amp;rsquo;s voice ceased, Kutúzov opened his eye as a miller wakes up when the soporific drone of the mill wheel is interrupted. He listened to what Langeron said, as if remarking, &amp;ldquo;So you are still at that silly business!&amp;rdquo; quickly closed his eye again, and let his head sink still lower.</p>
    <p>Langeron, trying as virulently as possible to sting Weyrother&amp;rsquo;s vanity as author of the military plan, argued that Bonaparte might easily attack instead of being attacked, and so render the whole of this plan perfectly worthless. Weyrother met all objections with a firm and contemptuous smile, evidently prepared beforehand to meet all objections be they what they might.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;If he could attack us, he would have done so today,&amp;rdquo; said he.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;So you think he is powerless?&amp;rdquo; said Langeron.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;He has forty thousand men at most,&amp;rdquo; replied Weyrother, with the smile of a doctor to whom an old wife wishes to explain the treatment of a case.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;In that case he is inviting his doom by awaiting our attack,&amp;rdquo; said Langeron, with a subtly ironical smile, again glancing round for support to Milorádovich who was near him.</p>
    <p>But Milorádovich was at that moment evidently thinking of anything rather than of what the generals were disputing about.</p>
    <p><i>&amp;ldquo;Ma foi!&amp;rdquo;</i> said he, &amp;ldquo;tomorrow we shall see all that on the battlefield.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Weyrother again gave that smile which seemed to say that to him it was strange and ridiculous to meet objections from Russian generals and to have to prove to them what he had not merely convinced himself of, but had also convinced the sovereign Emperors of.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;The enemy has quenched his fires and a continual noise is heard from his camp,&amp;rdquo; said he. &amp;ldquo;What does that mean? Either he is retreating, which is the only thing we need fear, or he is changing his position.&amp;rdquo; (He smiled ironically.) &amp;ldquo;But even if he also took up a position in the Thuerassa, he merely saves us a great deal of trouble and all our arrangements to the minutest detail remain the same.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;How is that?...&amp;rdquo; began Prince Andrew, who had for long been waiting an opportunity to express his doubts.</p>
    <p>Kutúzov here woke up, coughed heavily, and looked round at the generals.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Gentlemen, the dispositions for tomorrow&amp;mdash;or rather for today, for it is past midnight&amp;mdash;cannot now be altered,&amp;rdquo; said he. &amp;ldquo;You have heard them, and we shall all do our duty. But before a battle, there is nothing more important...&amp;rdquo; he paused, &amp;ldquo;than to have a good sleep.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>He moved as if to rise. The generals bowed and retired. It was past midnight. Prince Andrew went out.</p>
    <p>The council of war, at which Prince Andrew had not been able to express his opinion as he had hoped to, left on him a vague and uneasy impression. Whether Dolgorúkov and Weyrother, or Kutúzov, Langeron, and the others who did not approve of the plan of attack, were right&amp;mdash;he did not know. &amp;ldquo;But was it really not possible for Kutúzov to state his views plainly to the Emperor? Is it possible that on account of court and personal considerations tens of thousands of lives, and my life, <i>my</i> life,&amp;rdquo; he thought, &amp;ldquo;must be risked?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Yes, it is very likely that I shall be killed tomorrow,&amp;rdquo; he thought. And suddenly, at this thought of death, a whole series of most distant, most intimate, memories rose in his imagination: he remembered his last parting from his father and his wife; he remembered the days when he first loved her. He thought of her pregnancy and felt sorry for her and for himself, and in a nervously emotional and softened mood he went out of the hut in which he was billeted with Nesvítski and began to walk up and down before it.</p>
    <p>The night was foggy and through the fog the moonlight gleamed mysteriously. &amp;ldquo;Yes, tomorrow, tomorrow!&amp;rdquo; he thought. &amp;ldquo;Tomorrow everything may be over for me! All these memories will be no more, none of them will have any meaning for me. Tomorrow perhaps, even certainly, I have a presentiment that for the first time I shall have to show all I can do.&amp;rdquo; And his fancy pictured the battle, its loss, the concentration of fighting at one point, and the hesitation of all the commanders. And then that happy moment, that Toulon for which he had so long waited, presents itself to him at last. He firmly and clearly expresses his opinion to Kutúzov, to Weyrother, and to the Emperors. All are struck by the justness of his views, but no one undertakes to carry them out, so he takes a regiment, a division&amp;mdash;stipulates that no one is to interfere with his arrangements&amp;mdash;leads his division to the decisive point, and gains the victory alone. &amp;ldquo;But death and suffering?&amp;rdquo; suggested another voice. Prince Andrew, however, did not answer that voice and went on dreaming of his triumphs. The dispositions for the next battle are planned by him alone. Nominally he is only an adjutant on Kutúzov&amp;rsquo;s staff, but he does everything alone. The next battle is won by him alone. Kutúzov is removed and he is appointed... &amp;ldquo;Well and then?&amp;rdquo; asked the other voice. &amp;ldquo;If before that you are not ten times wounded, killed, or betrayed, well... what then?...&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Well then,&amp;rdquo; Prince Andrew answered himself, &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know what will happen and don&amp;rsquo;t want to know, and can&amp;rsquo;t, but if I want this&amp;mdash;want glory, want to be known to men, want to be loved by them, it is not my fault that I want it and want nothing but that and live only for that. Yes, for that alone! I shall never tell anyone, but, oh God! what am I to do if I love nothing but fame and men&amp;rsquo;s esteem? Death, wounds, the loss of family&amp;mdash;I fear nothing. And precious and dear as many persons are to me&amp;mdash;father, sister, wife&amp;mdash;those dearest to me&amp;mdash;yet dreadful and unnatural as it seems, I would give them all at once for a moment of glory, of triumph over men, of love from men I don&amp;rsquo;t know and never shall know, for the love of these men here,&amp;rdquo; he thought, as he listened to voices in Kutúzov&amp;rsquo;s courtyard. The voices were those of the orderlies who were packing up; one voice, probably a coachman&amp;rsquo;s, was teasing Kutúzov&amp;rsquo;s old cook whom Prince Andrew knew, and who was called Tit. He was saying, &amp;ldquo;Tit, I say, Tit!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well?&amp;rdquo; returned the old man.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Go, Tit, thresh a bit!&amp;rdquo; said the wag.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Oh, go to the devil!&amp;rdquo; called out a voice, drowned by the laughter of the orderlies and servants.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;All the same, I love and value nothing but triumph over them all, I value this mystic power and glory that is floating here above me in this mist!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
    <p>That same night, Rostóv was with a platoon on skirmishing duty in front of Bagratión&amp;rsquo;s detachment. His hussars were placed along the line in couples and he himself rode along the line trying to master the sleepiness that kept coming over him. An enormous space, with our army&amp;rsquo;s campfires dimly glowing in the fog, could be seen behind him; in front of him was misty darkness. Rostóv could see nothing, peer as he would into that foggy distance: now something gleamed gray, now there was something black, now little lights seemed to glimmer where the enemy ought to be, now he fancied it was only something in his own eyes. His eyes kept closing, and in his fancy appeared&amp;mdash;now the Emperor, now Denísov, and now Moscow memories&amp;mdash;and he again hurriedly opened his eyes and saw close before him the head and ears of the horse he was riding, and sometimes, when he came within six paces of them, the black figures of hussars, but in the distance was still the same misty darkness. &amp;ldquo;Why not?... It might easily happen,&amp;rdquo; thought Rostóv, &amp;ldquo;that the Emperor will meet me and give me an order as he would to any other officer; he&amp;rsquo;ll say: &amp;lsquo;Go and find out what&amp;rsquo;s there.&amp;rsquo; There are many stories of his getting to know an officer in just such a chance way and attaching him to himself! What if he gave me a place near him? Oh, how I would guard him, how I would tell him the truth, how I would unmask his deceivers!&amp;rdquo; And in order to realize vividly his love devotion to the sovereign, Rostóv pictured to himself an enemy or a deceitful German, whom he would not only kill with pleasure but whom he would slap in the face before the Emperor. Suddenly a distant shout aroused him. He started and opened his eyes.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Where am I? Oh yes, in the skirmishing line... pass and watchword&amp;mdash;<i>shaft, Olmütz.</i> What a nuisance that our squadron will be in reserve tomorrow,&amp;rdquo; he thought. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll ask leave to go to the front, this may be my only chance of seeing the Emperor. It won&amp;rsquo;t be long now before I am off duty. I&amp;rsquo;ll take another turn and when I get back I&amp;rsquo;ll go to the general and ask him.&amp;rdquo; He readjusted himself in the saddle and touched up his horse to ride once more round his hussars. It seemed to him that it was getting lighter. To the left he saw a sloping descent lit up, and facing it a black knoll that seemed as steep as a wall. On this knoll there was a white patch that Rostóv could not at all make out: was it a glade in the wood lit up by the moon, or some unmelted snow, or some white houses? He even thought something moved on that white spot. &amp;ldquo;I expect it&amp;rsquo;s snow... that spot... a spot&amp;mdash;<i>une tache</i>,&amp;rdquo; he thought. &amp;ldquo;There now... it&amp;rsquo;s not a <i>tache</i>... Natásha... sister, black eyes... Na... tasha... (Won&amp;rsquo;t she be surprised when I tell her how I&amp;rsquo;ve seen the Emperor?) Natásha... take my sabretache...&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;Keep to the right, your honor, there are bushes here,&amp;rdquo; came the voice of an hussar, past whom Rostóv was riding in the act of falling asleep. Rostóv lifted his head that had sunk almost to his horse&amp;rsquo;s mane and pulled up beside the hussar. He was succumbing to irresistible, youthful, childish drowsiness. &amp;ldquo;But what was I thinking? I mustn&amp;rsquo;t forget. How shall I speak to the Emperor? No, that&amp;rsquo;s not it&amp;mdash;that&amp;rsquo;s tomorrow. Oh yes! Natásha... sabretache... saber them... Whom? The hussars... Ah, the hussars with mustaches. Along the Tverskáya Street rode the hussar with mustaches... I thought about him too, just opposite Gúryev&amp;rsquo;s house... Old Gúryev.... Oh, but Denísov&amp;rsquo;s a fine fellow. But that&amp;rsquo;s all nonsense. The chief thing is that the Emperor is here. How he looked at me and wished to say something, but dared not.... No, it was I who dared not. But that&amp;rsquo;s nonsense, the chief thing is not to forget the important thing I was thinking of. Yes, Na-tásha, sabretache, oh, yes, yes! That&amp;rsquo;s right!&amp;rdquo; And his head once more sank to his horse&amp;rsquo;s neck. All at once it seemed to him that he was being fired at. &amp;ldquo;What? What? What?... Cut them down! What?...&amp;rdquo; said Rostóv, waking up. At the moment he opened his eyes he heard in front of him, where the enemy was, the long-drawn shouts of thousands of voices. His horse and the horse of the hussar near him pricked their ears at these shouts. Over there, where the shouting came from, a fire flared up and went out again, then another, and all along the French line on the hill fires flared up and the shouting grew louder and louder. Rostóv could hear the sound of French words but could not distinguish them. The din of many voices was too great; all he could hear was: &amp;ldquo;ahahah!&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;rrrr!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s that? What do you make of it?&amp;rdquo; said Rostóv to the hussar beside him. &amp;ldquo;That must be the enemy&amp;rsquo;s camp!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The hussar did not reply.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Why, don&amp;rsquo;t you hear it?&amp;rdquo; Rostóv asked again, after waiting for a reply.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Who can tell, your honor?&amp;rdquo; replied the hussar reluctantly.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;From the direction, it must be the enemy,&amp;rdquo; repeated Rostóv.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;It may be <i>he</i> or it may be nothing,&amp;rdquo; muttered the hussar. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s dark... Steady!&amp;rdquo; he cried to his fidgeting horse.</p>
    <p>Rostóv&amp;rsquo;s horse was also getting restive: it pawed the frozen ground, pricking its ears at the noise and looking at the lights. The shouting grew still louder and merged into a general roar that only an army of several thousand men could produce. The lights spread farther and farther, probably along the line of the French camp. Rostóv no longer wanted to sleep. The gay triumphant shouting of the enemy army had a stimulating effect on him. <i>&amp;ldquo;Vive l&amp;rsquo;Empereur! l&amp;rsquo;Empereur!&amp;rdquo;</i> he now heard distinctly.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;They can&amp;rsquo;t be far off, probably just beyond the stream,&amp;rdquo; he said to the hussar beside him.</p>
    <p>The hussar only sighed without replying and coughed angrily. The sound of horse&amp;rsquo;s hoofs approaching at a trot along the line of hussars was heard, and out of the foggy darkness the figure of a sergeant of hussars suddenly appeared, looming huge as an elephant.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Your honor, the generals!&amp;rdquo; said the sergeant, riding up to Rostóv.</p>
    <p>Rostóv, still looking round toward the fires and the shouts, rode with the sergeant to meet some mounted men who were riding along the line. One was on a white horse. Prince Bagratión and Prince Dolgorúkov with their adjutants had come to witness the curious phenomenon of the lights and shouts in the enemy&amp;rsquo;s camp. Rostóv rode up to Bagratión, reported to him, and then joined the adjutants listening to what the generals were saying.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Believe me,&amp;rdquo; said Prince Dolgorúkov, addressing Bagratión, &amp;ldquo;it is nothing but a trick! He has retreated and ordered the rearguard to kindle fires and make a noise to deceive us.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Hardly,&amp;rdquo; said Bagratión. &amp;ldquo;I saw them this evening on that knoll; if they had retreated they would have withdrawn from that too.... Officer!&amp;rdquo; said Bagratión to Rostóv, &amp;ldquo;are the enemy&amp;rsquo;s skirmishers still there?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;They were there this evening, but now I don&amp;rsquo;t know, your excellency. Shall I go with some of my hussars to see?&amp;rdquo; replied Rostóv.</p>
    <p>Bagratión stopped and, before replying, tried to see Rostóv&amp;rsquo;s face in the mist.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well, go and see,&amp;rdquo; he said, after a pause.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Yes, sir.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Rostóv spurred his horse, called to Sergeant Fédchenko and two other hussars, told them to follow him, and trotted downhill in the direction from which the shouting came. He felt both frightened and pleased to be riding alone with three hussars into that mysterious and dangerous misty distance where no one had been before him. Bagratión called to him from the hill not to go beyond the stream, but Rostóv pretended not to hear him and did not stop but rode on and on, continually mistaking bushes for trees and gullies for men and continually discovering his mistakes. Having descended the hill at a trot, he no longer saw either our own or the enemy&amp;rsquo;s fires, but heard the shouting of the French more loudly and distinctly. In the valley he saw before him something like a river, but when he reached it he found it was a road. Having come out onto the road he reined in his horse, hesitating whether to ride along it or cross it and ride over the black field up the hillside. To keep to the road which gleamed white in the mist would have been safer because it would be easier to see people coming along it. &amp;ldquo;Follow me!&amp;rdquo; said he, crossed the road, and began riding up the hill at a gallop toward the point where the French pickets had been standing that evening.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Your honor, there he is!&amp;rdquo; cried one of the hussars behind him. And before Rostóv had time to make out what the black thing was that had suddenly appeared in the fog, there was a flash, followed by a report, and a bullet whizzing high up in the mist with a plaintive sound passed out of hearing. Another musket missed fire but flashed in the pan. Rostóv turned his horse and galloped back. Four more reports followed at intervals, and the bullets passed somewhere in the fog singing in different tones. Rostóv reined in his horse, whose spirits had risen, like his own, at the firing, and went back at a footpace. &amp;ldquo;Well, some more! Some more!&amp;rdquo; a merry voice was saying in his soul. But no more shots came.</p>
    <p>Only when approaching Bagratión did Rostóv let his horse gallop again, and with his hand at the salute rode up to the general.</p>
    <p>Dolgorúkov was still insisting that the French had retreated and had only lit fires to deceive us.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;What does that prove?&amp;rdquo; he was saying as Rostóv rode up. &amp;ldquo;They might retreat and leave the pickets.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s plain that they have not all gone yet, Prince,&amp;rdquo; said Bagratión. &amp;ldquo;Wait till tomorrow morning, we&amp;rsquo;ll find out everything tomorrow.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;The picket is still on the hill, your excellency, just where it was in the evening,&amp;rdquo; reported Rostóv, stooping forward with his hand at the salute and unable to repress the smile of delight induced by his ride and especially by the sound of the bullets.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Very good, very good,&amp;rdquo; said Bagratión. &amp;ldquo;Thank you, officer.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Your excellency,&amp;rdquo; said Rostóv, &amp;ldquo;may I ask a favor?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;What is it?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Tomorrow our squadron is to be in reserve. May I ask to be attached to the first squadron?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s your name?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Count Rostóv.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Oh, very well, you may stay in attendance on me.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Count Ilyá Rostóv&amp;rsquo;s son?&amp;rdquo; asked Dolgorúkov.</p>
    <p>But Rostóv did not reply.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Then I may reckon on it, your excellency?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I will give the order.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Tomorrow very likely I may be sent with some message to the Emperor,&amp;rdquo; thought Rostóv.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Thank God!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The fires and shouting in the enemy&amp;rsquo;s army were occasioned by the fact that while Napoleon&amp;rsquo;s proclamation was being read to the troops the Emperor himself rode round his bivouacs. The soldiers, on seeing him, lit wisps of straw and ran after him, shouting, <i>&amp;ldquo;Vive l&amp;rsquo;Empereur!&amp;rdquo;</i> Napoleon&amp;rsquo;s proclamation was as follows:</p>
    <p>Soldiers! The Russian army is advancing against you to avenge the Austrian army of Ulm. They are the same battalions you broke at Hollabrünn and have pursued ever since to this place. The position we occupy is a strong one, and while they are marching to go round me on the right they will expose a flank to me. Soldiers! I will myself direct your battalions. I will keep out of fire if you with your habitual valor carry disorder and confusion into the enemy&amp;rsquo;s ranks, but should victory be in doubt, even for a moment, you will see your Emperor exposing himself to the first blows of the enemy, for there must be no doubt of victory, especially on this day when what is at stake is the honor of the French infantry, so necessary to the honor of our nation.</p>
    <p>Do not break your ranks on the plea of removing the wounded! Let every man be fully imbued with the thought that we must defeat these hirelings of England, inspired by such hatred of our nation! This victory will conclude our campaign and we can return to winter quarters, where fresh French troops who are being raised in France will join us, and the peace I shall conclude will be worthy of my people, of you, and of myself.</p>
    <p>NAPOLEON</p>
    <h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
    <p>At five in the morning it was still quite dark. The troops of the center, the reserves, and Bagratión&amp;rsquo;s right flank had not yet moved, but on the left flank the columns of infantry, cavalry, and artillery, which were to be the first to descend the heights to attack the French right flank and drive it into the Bohemian mountains according to plan, were already up and astir. The smoke of the campfires, into which they were throwing everything superfluous, made the eyes smart. It was cold and dark. The officers were hurriedly drinking tea and breakfasting, the soldiers, munching biscuit and beating a tattoo with their feet to warm themselves, gathering round the fires throwing into the flames the remains of sheds, chairs, tables, wheels, tubs, and everything that they did not want or could not carry away with them. Austrian column guides were moving in and out among the Russian troops and served as heralds of the advance. As soon as an Austrian officer showed himself near a commanding officer&amp;rsquo;s quarters, the regiment began to move: the soldiers ran from the fires, thrust their pipes into their boots, their bags into the carts, got their muskets ready, and formed rank. The officers buttoned up their coats, buckled on their swords and pouches, and moved along the ranks shouting. The train drivers and orderlies harnessed and packed the wagons and tied on the loads. The adjutants and battalion and regimental commanders mounted, crossed themselves, gave final instructions, orders, and commissions to the baggage men who remained behind, and the monotonous tramp of thousands of feet resounded. The column moved forward without knowing where and unable, from the masses around them, the smoke and the increasing fog, to see either the place they were leaving or that to which they were going.</p>
    <p>A soldier on the march is hemmed in and borne along by his regiment as much as a sailor is by his ship. However far he has walked, whatever strange, unknown, and dangerous places he reaches, just as a sailor is always surrounded by the same decks, masts, and rigging of his ship, so the soldier always has around him the same comrades, the same ranks, the same sergeant major Iván Mítrich, the same company dog Jack, and the same commanders. The sailor rarely cares to know the latitude in which his ship is sailing, but on the day of battle&amp;mdash;heaven knows how and whence&amp;mdash;a stern note of which all are conscious sounds in the moral atmosphere of an army, announcing the approach of something decisive and solemn, and awakening in the men an unusual curiosity. On the day of battle the soldiers excitedly try to get beyond the interests of their regiment, they listen intently, look about, and eagerly ask concerning what is going on around them.</p>
    <p>The fog had grown so dense that though it was growing light they could not see ten paces ahead. Bushes looked like gigantic trees and level ground like cliffs and slopes. Anywhere, on any side, one might encounter an enemy invisible ten paces off. But the columns advanced for a long time, always in the same fog, descending and ascending hills, avoiding gardens and enclosures, going over new and unknown ground, and nowhere encountering the enemy. On the contrary, the soldiers became aware that in front, behind, and on all sides, other Russian columns were moving in the same direction. Every soldier felt glad to know that to the unknown place where he was going, many more of our men were going too.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;There now, the Kúrskies have also gone past,&amp;rdquo; was being said in the ranks.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s wonderful what a lot of our troops have gathered, lads! Last night I looked at the campfires and there was no end of them. A regular Moscow!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Though none of the column commanders rode up to the ranks or talked to the men (the commanders, as we saw at the council of war, were out of humor and dissatisfied with the affair, and so did not exert themselves to cheer the men but merely carried out the orders), yet the troops marched gaily, as they always do when going into action, especially to an attack. But when they had marched for about an hour in the dense fog, the greater part of the men had to halt and an unpleasant consciousness of some dislocation and blunder spread through the ranks. How such a consciousness is communicated is very difficult to define, but it certainly is communicated very surely, and flows rapidly, imperceptibly, and irrepressibly, as water does in a creek. Had the Russian army been alone without any allies, it might perhaps have been a long time before this consciousness of mismanagement became a general conviction, but as it was, the disorder was readily and naturally attributed to the stupid Germans, and everyone was convinced that a dangerous muddle had been occasioned by the sausage eaters.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Why have we stopped? Is the way blocked? Or have we already come up against the French?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;No, one can&amp;rsquo;t hear them. They&amp;rsquo;d be firing if we had.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;They were in a hurry enough to start us, and now here we stand in the middle of a field without rhyme or reason. It&amp;rsquo;s all those damned Germans&amp;rsquo; muddling! What stupid devils!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Yes, I&amp;rsquo;d send them on in front, but no fear, they&amp;rsquo;re crowding up behind. And now here we stand hungry.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I say, shall we soon be clear? They say the cavalry are blocking the way,&amp;rdquo; said an officer.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Ah, those damned Germans! They don&amp;rsquo;t know their own country!&amp;rdquo; said another.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;What division are you?&amp;rdquo; shouted an adjutant, riding up.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;The Eighteenth.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Then why are you here? You should have gone on long ago, now you won&amp;rsquo;t get there till evening.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;What stupid orders! They don&amp;rsquo;t themselves know what they are doing!&amp;rdquo; said the officer and rode off.</p>
    <p>Then a general rode past shouting something angrily, not in Russian.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Tafa-lafa! But what he&amp;rsquo;s jabbering no one can make out,&amp;rdquo; said a soldier, mimicking the general who had ridden away. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;d shoot them, the scoundrels!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;We were ordered to be at the place before nine, but we haven&amp;rsquo;t got halfway. Fine orders!&amp;rdquo; was being repeated on different sides.</p>
    <p>And the feeling of energy with which the troops had started began to turn into vexation and anger at the stupid arrangements and at the Germans.</p>
    <p>The cause of the confusion was that while the Austrian cavalry was moving toward our left flank, the higher command found that our center was too far separated from our right flank and the cavalry were all ordered to turn back to the right. Several thousand cavalry crossed in front of the infantry, who had to wait.</p>
    <p>At the front an altercation occurred between an Austrian guide and a Russian general. The general shouted a demand that the cavalry should be halted, the Austrian argued that not he, but the higher command, was to blame. The troops meanwhile stood growing listless and dispirited. After an hour&amp;rsquo;s delay they at last moved on, descending the hill. The fog that was dispersing on the hill lay still more densely below, where they were descending. In front in the fog a shot was heard and then another, at first irregularly at varying intervals&amp;mdash;trata...tat&amp;mdash;and then more and more regularly and rapidly, and the action at the Goldbach Stream began.</p>
    <p>Not expecting to come on the enemy down by the stream, and having stumbled on him in the fog, hearing no encouraging word from their commanders, and with a consciousness of being too late spreading through the ranks, and above all being unable to see anything in front or around them in the thick fog, the Russians exchanged shots with the enemy lazily and advanced and again halted, receiving no timely orders from the officers or adjutants who wandered about in the fog in those unknown surroundings unable to find their own regiments. In this way the action began for the first, second, and third columns, which had gone down into the valley. The fourth column, with which Kutúzov was, stood on the Pratzen Heights.</p>
    <p>Below, where the fight was beginning, there was still thick fog; on the higher ground it was clearing, but nothing could be seen of what was going on in front. Whether all the enemy forces were, as we supposed, six miles away, or whether they were near by in that sea of mist, no one knew till after eight o&amp;rsquo;clock.</p>
    <p>It was nine o&amp;rsquo;clock in the morning. The fog lay unbroken like a sea down below, but higher up at the village of Schlappanitz where Napoleon stood with his marshals around him, it was quite light. Above him was a clear blue sky, and the sun&amp;rsquo;s vast orb quivered like a huge hollow, crimson float on the surface of that milky sea of mist. The whole French army, and even Napoleon himself with his staff, were not on the far side of the streams and hollows of Sokolnitz and Schlappanitz beyond which we intended to take up our position and begin the action, but were on this side, so close to our own forces that Napoleon with the naked eye could distinguish a mounted man from one on foot. Napoleon, in the blue cloak which he had worn on his Italian campaign, sat on his small gray Arab horse a little in front of his marshals. He gazed silently at the hills which seemed to rise out of the sea of mist and on which the Russian troops were moving in the distance, and he listened to the sounds of firing in the valley. Not a single muscle of his face&amp;mdash;which in those days was still thin&amp;mdash;moved. His gleaming eyes were fixed intently on one spot. His predictions were being justified. Part of the Russian force had already descended into the valley toward the ponds and lakes and part were leaving these Pratzen Heights which he intended to attack and regarded as the key to the position. He saw over the mist that in a hollow between two hills near the village of Pratzen, the Russian columns, their bayonets glittering, were moving continuously in one direction toward the valley and disappearing one after another into the mist. From information he had received the evening before, from the sound of wheels and footsteps heard by the outposts during the night, by the disorderly movement of the Russian columns, and from all indications, he saw clearly that the allies believed him to be far away in front of them, and that the columns moving near Pratzen constituted the center of the Russian army, and that that center was already sufficiently weakened to be successfully attacked. But still he did not begin the engagement.</p>
    <p>Today was a great day for him&amp;mdash;the anniversary of his coronation. Before dawn he had slept for a few hours, and refreshed, vigorous, and in good spirits, he mounted his horse and rode out into the field in that happy mood in which everything seems possible and everything succeeds. He sat motionless, looking at the heights visible above the mist, and his cold face wore that special look of confident, self-complacent happiness that one sees on the face of a boy happily in love. The marshals stood behind him not venturing to distract his attention. He looked now at the Pratzen Heights, now at the sun floating up out of the mist.</p>
    <p>When the sun had entirely emerged from the fog, and fields and mist were aglow with dazzling light&amp;mdash;as if he had only awaited this to begin the action&amp;mdash;he drew the glove from his shapely white hand, made a sign with it to the marshals, and ordered the action to begin. The marshals, accompanied by adjutants, galloped off in different directions, and a few minutes later the chief forces of the French army moved rapidly toward those Pratzen Heights which were being more and more denuded by Russian troops moving down the valley to their left.</p>
    <h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
    <p>At eight o&amp;rsquo;clock Kutúzov rode to Pratzen at the head of the fourth column, Milorádovich&amp;rsquo;s, the one that was to take the place of Przebyszéwski&amp;rsquo;s and Langeron&amp;rsquo;s columns which had already gone down into the valley. He greeted the men of the foremost regiment and gave them the order to march, thereby indicating that he intended to lead that column himself. When he had reached the village of Pratzen he halted. Prince Andrew was behind, among the immense number forming the commander in chief&amp;rsquo;s suite. He was in a state of suppressed excitement and irritation, though controlledly calm as a man is at the approach of a long-awaited moment. He was firmly convinced that this was the day of his Toulon, or his bridge of Arcola. How it would come about he did not know, but he felt sure it would do so. The locality and the position of our troops were known to him as far as they could be known to anyone in our army. His own strategic plan, which obviously could not now be carried out, was forgotten. Now, entering into Weyrother&amp;rsquo;s plan, Prince Andrew considered possible contingencies and formed new projects such as might call for his rapidity of perception and decision.</p>
    <p>To the left down below in the mist, the musketry fire of unseen forces could be heard. It was there Prince Andrew thought the fight would concentrate. &amp;ldquo;There we shall encounter difficulties, and there,&amp;rdquo; thought he, &amp;ldquo;I shall be sent with a brigade or division, and there, standard in hand, I shall go forward and break whatever is in front of me.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>He could not look calmly at the standards of the passing battalions. Seeing them he kept thinking, &amp;ldquo;That may be the very standard with which I shall lead the army.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>In the morning all that was left of the night mist on the heights was a hoar frost now turning to dew, but in the valleys it still lay like a milk-white sea. Nothing was visible in the valley to the left into which our troops had descended and from whence came the sounds of firing. Above the heights was the dark clear sky, and to the right the vast orb of the sun. In front, far off on the farther shore of that sea of mist, some wooded hills were discernible, and it was there the enemy probably was, for something could be descried. On the right the Guards were entering the misty region with a sound of hoofs and wheels and now and then a gleam of bayonets; to the left beyond the village similar masses of cavalry came up and disappeared in the sea of mist. In front and behind moved infantry. The commander in chief was standing at the end of the village letting the troops pass by him. That morning Kutúzov seemed worn and irritable. The infantry passing before him came to a halt without any command being given, apparently obstructed by something in front.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Do order them to form into battalion columns and go round the village!&amp;rdquo; he said angrily to a general who had ridden up. &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t you understand, your excellency, my dear sir, that you must not defile through narrow village streets when we are marching against the enemy?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I intended to re-form them beyond the village, your excellency,&amp;rdquo; answered the general.</p>
    <p>Kutúzov laughed bitterly.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;ll make a fine thing of it, deploying in sight of the enemy! Very fine!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;The enemy is still far away, your excellency. According to the dispositions...&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;The dispositions!&amp;rdquo; exclaimed Kutúzov bitterly. &amp;ldquo;Who told you that?... Kindly do as you are ordered.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Yes, sir.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;My dear fellow,&amp;rdquo; Nesvítski whispered to Prince Andrew, &amp;ldquo;the old man is as surly as a dog.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>An Austrian officer in a white uniform with green plumes in his hat galloped up to Kutúzov and asked in the Emperor&amp;rsquo;s name had the fourth column advanced into action.</p>
    <p>Kutúzov turned round without answering and his eye happened to fall upon Prince Andrew, who was beside him. Seeing him, Kutúzov&amp;rsquo;s malevolent and caustic expression softened, as if admitting that what was being done was not his adjutant&amp;rsquo;s fault, and still not answering the Austrian adjutant, he addressed Bolkónski.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Go, my dear fellow, and see whether the third division has passed the village. Tell it to stop and await my orders.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Hardly had Prince Andrew started than he stopped him.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;And ask whether sharpshooters have been posted,&amp;rdquo; he added. &amp;ldquo;What are they doing? What are they doing?&amp;rdquo; he murmured to himself, still not replying to the Austrian.</p>
    <p>Prince Andrew galloped off to execute the order.</p>
    <p>Overtaking the battalions that continued to advance, he stopped the third division and convinced himself that there really were no sharpshooters in front of our columns. The colonel at the head of the regiment was much surprised at the commander in chief&amp;rsquo;s order to throw out skirmishers. He had felt perfectly sure that there were other troops in front of him and that the enemy must be at least six miles away. There was really nothing to be seen in front except a barren descent hidden by dense mist. Having given orders in the commander in chief&amp;rsquo;s name to rectify this omission, Prince Andrew galloped back. Kutúzov still in the same place, his stout body resting heavily in the saddle with the lassitude of age, sat yawning wearily with closed eyes. The troops were no longer moving, but stood with the butts of their muskets on the ground.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;All right, all right!&amp;rdquo; he said to Prince Andrew, and turned to a general who, watch in hand, was saying it was time they started as all the left-flank columns had already descended.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Plenty of time, your excellency,&amp;rdquo; muttered Kutúzov in the midst of a yawn. &amp;ldquo;Plenty of time,&amp;rdquo; he repeated.</p>
    <p>Just then at a distance behind Kutúzov was heard the sound of regiments saluting, and this sound rapidly came nearer along the whole extended line of the advancing Russian columns. Evidently the person they were greeting was riding quickly. When the soldiers of the regiment in front of which Kutúzov was standing began to shout, he rode a little to one side and looked round with a frown. Along the road from Pratzen galloped what looked like a squadron of horsemen in various uniforms. Two of them rode side by side in front, at full gallop. One in a black uniform with white plumes in his hat rode a bobtailed chestnut horse, the other who was in a white uniform rode a black one. These were the two Emperors followed by their suites. Kutúzov, affecting the manners of an old soldier at the front, gave the command &amp;ldquo;Attention!&amp;rdquo; and rode up to the Emperors with a salute. His whole appearance and manner were suddenly transformed. He put on the air of a subordinate who obeys without reasoning. With an affectation of respect which evidently struck Alexander unpleasantly, he rode up and saluted.</p>
    <p>This unpleasant impression merely flitted over the young and happy face of the Emperor like a cloud of haze across a clear sky and vanished. After his illness he looked rather thinner that day than on the field of Olmütz where Bolkónski had seen him for the first time abroad, but there was still the same bewitching combination of majesty and mildness in his fine gray eyes, and on his delicate lips the same capacity for varying expression and the same prevalent appearance of goodhearted innocent youth.</p>
    <p>At the Olmütz review he had seemed more majestic; here he seemed brighter and more energetic. He was slightly flushed after galloping two miles, and reining in his horse he sighed restfully and looked round at the faces of his suite, young and animated as his own. Czartorýski, Novosíltsev, Prince Volkónsky, Strógonov, and the others, all richly dressed gay young men on splendid, well-groomed, fresh, only slightly heated horses, exchanging remarks and smiling, had stopped behind the Emperor. The Emperor Francis, a rosy, long faced young man, sat very erect on his handsome black horse, looking about him in a leisurely and preoccupied manner. He beckoned to one of his white adjutants and asked some question&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;Most likely he is asking at what o&amp;rsquo;clock they started,&amp;rdquo; thought Prince Andrew, watching his old acquaintance with a smile he could not repress as he recalled his reception at Brünn. In the Emperors&amp;rsquo; suite were the picked young orderly officers of the Guard and line regiments, Russian and Austrian. Among them were grooms leading the Tsar&amp;rsquo;s beautiful relay horses covered with embroidered cloths.</p>
    <p>As when a window is opened a whiff of fresh air from the fields enters a stuffy room, so a whiff of youthfulness, energy, and confidence of success reached Kutúzov&amp;rsquo;s cheerless staff with the galloping advent of all these brilliant young men.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Why aren&amp;rsquo;t you beginning, Michael Ilariónovich?&amp;rdquo; said the Emperor Alexander hurriedly to Kutúzov, glancing courteously at the same time at the Emperor Francis.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I am waiting, Your Majesty,&amp;rdquo; answered Kutúzov, bending forward respectfully.</p>
    <p>The Emperor, frowning slightly, bent his ear forward as if he had not quite heard.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Waiting, Your Majesty,&amp;rdquo; repeated Kutúzov. (Prince Andrew noted that Kutúzov&amp;rsquo;s upper lip twitched unnaturally as he said the word &amp;ldquo;waiting.&amp;rdquo;) &amp;ldquo;Not all the columns have formed up yet, Your Majesty.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The Tsar heard but obviously did not like the reply; he shrugged his rather round shoulders and glanced at Novosíltsev who was near him, as if complaining of Kutúzov.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;You know, Michael Ilariónovich, we are not on the Empress&amp;rsquo; Field where a parade does not begin till all the troops are assembled,&amp;rdquo; said the Tsar with another glance at the Emperor Francis, as if inviting him if not to join in at least to listen to what he was saying. But the Emperor Francis continued to look about him and did not listen.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;That is just why I do not begin, sire,&amp;rdquo; said Kutúzov in a resounding voice, apparently to preclude the possibility of not being heard, and again something in his face twitched&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;That is just why I do not begin, sire, because we are not on parade and not on the Empress&amp;rsquo; Field,&amp;rdquo; said he clearly and distinctly.</p>
    <p>In the Emperor&amp;rsquo;s suite all exchanged rapid looks that expressed dissatisfaction and reproach. &amp;ldquo;Old though he may be, he should not, he certainly should not, speak like that,&amp;rdquo; their glances seemed to say.</p>
    <p>The Tsar looked intently and observantly into Kutúzov&amp;rsquo;s eye waiting to hear whether he would say anything more. But Kutúzov, with respectfully bowed head, seemed also to be waiting. The silence lasted for about a minute.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;However, if you command it, Your Majesty,&amp;rdquo; said Kutúzov, lifting his head and again assuming his former tone of a dull, unreasoning, but submissive general.</p>
    <p>He touched his horse and having called Milorádovich, the commander of the column, gave him the order to advance.</p>
    <p>The troops again began to move, and two battalions of the Nóvgorod and one of the Ápsheron regiment went forward past the Emperor.</p>
    <p>As this Ápsheron battalion marched by, the red-faced Milorádovich, without his greatcoat, with his Orders on his breast and an enormous tuft of plumes in his cocked hat worn on one side with its corners front and back, galloped strenuously forward, and with a dashing salute reined in his horse before the Emperor.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;God be with you, general!&amp;rdquo; said the Emperor.</p>
    <p><i>&amp;ldquo;Ma foi, sire, nous ferons ce qui sera dans notre possibilité, sire,&amp;rdquo;</i> * he answered gaily, raising nevertheless ironic smiles among the gentlemen of the Tsar&amp;rsquo;s suite by his poor French.</p>
    <pre class="testable">* &amp;ldquo;Indeed, Sire, we shall do everything it is possible to do, Sire.&amp;rdquo;</pre>
    <p>Milorádovich wheeled his horse sharply and stationed himself a little behind the Emperor. The Ápsheron men, excited by the Tsar&amp;rsquo;s presence, passed in step before the Emperors and their suites at a bold, brisk pace.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Lads!&amp;rdquo; shouted Milorádovich in a loud, self-confident, and cheery voice, obviously so elated by the sound of firing, by the prospect of battle, and by the sight of the gallant Ápsherons, his comrades in Suvórov&amp;rsquo;s time, now passing so gallantly before the Emperors, that he forgot the sovereigns&amp;rsquo; presence. &amp;ldquo;Lads, it&amp;rsquo;s not the first village you&amp;rsquo;ve had to take,&amp;rdquo; cried he.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Glad to do our best!&amp;rdquo; shouted the soldiers.</p>
    <p>The Emperor&amp;rsquo;s horse started at the sudden cry. This horse that had carried the sovereign at reviews in Russia bore him also here on the field of Austerlitz, enduring the heedless blows of his left foot and pricking its ears at the sound of shots just as it had done on the Empress&amp;rsquo; Field, not understanding the significance of the firing, nor of the nearness of the Emperor Francis&amp;rsquo; black cob, nor of all that was being said, thought, and felt that day by its rider.</p>
    <p>The Emperor turned with a smile to one of his followers and made a remark to him, pointing to the gallant Ápsherons.</p>
    <h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
    <p>Kutúzov accompanied by his adjutants rode at a walking pace behind the carabineers.</p>
    <p>When he had gone less than half a mile in the rear of the column he stopped at a solitary, deserted house that had probably once been an inn, where two roads parted. Both of them led downhill and troops were marching along both.</p>
    <p>The fog had begun to clear and enemy troops were already dimly visible about a mile and a half off on the opposite heights. Down below, on the left, the firing became more distinct. Kutúzov had stopped and was speaking to an Austrian general. Prince Andrew, who was a little behind looking at them, turned to an adjutant to ask him for a field glass.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Look, look!&amp;rdquo; said this adjutant, looking not at the troops in the distance, but down the hill before him. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s the French!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The two generals and the adjutant took hold of the field glass, trying to snatch it from one another. The expression on all their faces suddenly changed to one of horror. The French were supposed to be a mile and a half away, but had suddenly and unexpectedly appeared just in front of us.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s the enemy?... No!... Yes, see it is!... for certain.... But how is that?&amp;rdquo; said different voices.</p>
    <p>With the naked eye Prince Andrew saw below them to the right, not more than five hundred paces from where Kutúzov was standing, a dense French column coming up to meet the Ápsherons.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Here it is! The decisive moment has arrived. My turn has come,&amp;rdquo; thought Prince Andrew, and striking his horse he rode up to Kutúzov.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;The Ápsherons must be stopped, your excellency,&amp;rdquo; cried he. But at that very instant a cloud of smoke spread all round, firing was heard quite close at hand, and a voice of naïve terror barely two steps from Prince Andrew shouted, &amp;ldquo;Brothers! All&amp;rsquo;s lost!&amp;rdquo; And at this as if at a command, everyone began to run.</p>
    <p>Confused and ever-increasing crowds were running back to where five minutes before the troops had passed the Emperors. Not only would it have been difficult to stop that crowd, it was even impossible not to be carried back with it oneself. Bolkónski only tried not to lose touch with it, and looked around bewildered and unable to grasp what was happening in front of him. Nesvítski with an angry face, red and unlike himself, was shouting to Kutúzov that if he did not ride away at once he would certainly be taken prisoner. Kutúzov remained in the same place and without answering drew out a handkerchief. Blood was flowing from his cheek. Prince Andrew forced his way to him.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;You are wounded?&amp;rdquo; he asked, hardly able to master the trembling of his lower jaw.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;The wound is not here, it is there!&amp;rdquo; said Kutúzov, pressing the handkerchief to his wounded cheek and pointing to the fleeing soldiers. &amp;ldquo;Stop them!&amp;rdquo; he shouted, and at the same moment, probably realizing that it was impossible to stop them, spurred his horse and rode to the right.</p>
    <p>A fresh wave of the flying mob caught him and bore him back with it.</p>
    <p>The troops were running in such a dense mass that once surrounded by them it was difficult to get out again. One was shouting, &amp;ldquo;Get on! Why are you hindering us?&amp;rdquo; Another in the same place turned round and fired in the air; a third was striking the horse Kutúzov himself rode. Having by a great effort got away to the left from that flood of men, Kutúzov, with his suite diminished by more than half, rode toward a sound of artillery fire near by. Having forced his way out of the crowd of fugitives, Prince Andrew, trying to keep near Kutúzov, saw on the slope of the hill amid the smoke a Russian battery that was still firing and Frenchmen running toward it. Higher up stood some Russian infantry, neither moving forward to protect the battery nor backward with the fleeing crowd. A mounted general separated himself from the infantry and approached Kutúzov. Of Kutúzov&amp;rsquo;s suite only four remained. They were all pale and exchanged looks in silence.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Stop those wretches!&amp;rdquo; gasped Kutúzov to the regimental commander, pointing to the flying soldiers; but at that instant, as if to punish him for those words, bullets flew hissing across the regiment and across Kutúzov&amp;rsquo;s suite like a flock of little birds.</p>
    <p>The French had attacked the battery and, seeing Kutúzov, were firing at him. After this volley the regimental commander clutched at his leg; several soldiers fell, and a second lieutenant who was holding the flag let it fall from his hands. It swayed and fell, but caught on the muskets of the nearest soldiers. The soldiers started firing without orders.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Oh! Oh! Oh!&amp;rdquo; groaned Kutúzov despairingly and looked around.... &amp;ldquo;Bolkónski!&amp;rdquo; he whispered, his voice trembling from a consciousness of the feebleness of age, &amp;ldquo;Bolkónski!&amp;rdquo; he whispered, pointing to the disordered battalion and at the enemy, &amp;ldquo;what&amp;rsquo;s that?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>But before he had finished speaking, Prince Andrew, feeling tears of shame and anger choking him, had already leapt from his horse and run to the standard.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Forward, lads!&amp;rdquo; he shouted in a voice piercing as a child&amp;rsquo;s.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Here it is!&amp;rdquo; thought he, seizing the staff of the standard and hearing with pleasure the whistle of bullets evidently aimed at him. Several soldiers fell.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Hurrah!&amp;rdquo; shouted Prince Andrew, and, scarcely able to hold up the heavy standard, he ran forward with full confidence that the whole battalion would follow him.</p>
    <p>And really he only ran a few steps alone. One soldier moved and then another and soon the whole battalion ran forward shouting &amp;ldquo;Hurrah!&amp;rdquo; and overtook him. A sergeant of the battalion ran up and took the flag that was swaying from its weight in Prince Andrew&amp;rsquo;s hands, but he was immediately killed. Prince Andrew again seized the standard and, dragging it by the staff, ran on with the battalion. In front he saw our artillerymen, some of whom were fighting, while others, having abandoned their guns, were running toward him. He also saw French infantry soldiers who were seizing the artillery horses and turning the guns round. Prince Andrew and the battalion were already within twenty paces of the cannon. He heard the whistle of bullets above him unceasingly and to right and left of him soldiers continually groaned and dropped. But he did not look at them: he looked only at what was going on in front of him&amp;mdash;at the battery. He now saw clearly the figure of a red-haired gunner with his shako knocked awry, pulling one end of a mop while a French soldier tugged at the other. He could distinctly see the distraught yet angry expression on the faces of these two men, who evidently did not realize what they were doing.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;What are they about?&amp;rdquo; thought Prince Andrew as he gazed at them. &amp;ldquo;Why doesn&amp;rsquo;t the red-haired gunner run away as he is unarmed? Why doesn&amp;rsquo;t the Frenchman stab him? He will not get away before the Frenchman remembers his bayonet and stabs him....&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>And really another French soldier, trailing his musket, ran up to the struggling men, and the fate of the red-haired gunner, who had triumphantly secured the mop and still did not realize what awaited him, was about to be decided. But Prince Andrew did not see how it ended. It seemed to him as though one of the soldiers near him hit him on the head with the full swing of a bludgeon. It hurt a little, but the worst of it was that the pain distracted him and prevented his seeing what he had been looking at.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s this? Am I falling? My legs are giving way,&amp;rdquo; thought he, and fell on his back. He opened his eyes, hoping to see how the struggle of the Frenchmen with the gunners ended, whether the red-haired gunner had been killed or not and whether the cannon had been captured or saved. But he saw nothing. Above him there was now nothing but the sky&amp;mdash;the lofty sky, not clear yet still immeasurably lofty, with gray clouds gliding slowly across it. &amp;ldquo;How quiet, peaceful, and solemn; not at all as I ran,&amp;rdquo; thought Prince Andrew&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;not as we ran, shouting and fighting, not at all as the gunner and the Frenchman with frightened and angry faces struggled for the mop: how differently do those clouds glide across that lofty infinite sky! How was it I did not see that lofty sky before? And how happy I am to have found it at last! Yes! All is vanity, all falsehood, except that infinite sky. There is nothing, nothing, but that. But even it does not exist, there is nothing but quiet and peace. Thank God!...&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
    <p>On our right flank commanded by Bagratión, at nine o&amp;rsquo;clock the battle had not yet begun. Not wishing to agree to Dolgorúkov&amp;rsquo;s demand to commence the action, and wishing to avert responsibility from himself, Prince Bagratión proposed to Dolgorúkov to send to inquire of the commander in chief. Bagratión knew that as the distance between the two flanks was more than six miles, even if the messenger were not killed (which he very likely would be), and found the commander in chief (which would be very difficult), he would not be able to get back before evening.</p>
    <p>Bagratión cast his large, expressionless, sleepy eyes round his suite, and the boyish face Rostóv, breathless with excitement and hope, was the first to catch his eye. He sent him.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;And if I should meet His Majesty before I meet the commander in chief, your excellency?&amp;rdquo; said Rostóv, with his hand to his cap.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;You can give the message to His Majesty,&amp;rdquo; said Dolgorúkov, hurriedly interrupting Bagratión.</p>
    <p>On being relieved from picket duty Rostóv had managed to get a few hours&amp;rsquo; sleep before morning and felt cheerful, bold, and resolute, with elasticity of movement, faith in his good fortune, and generally in that state of mind which makes everything seem possible, pleasant, and easy.</p>
    <p>All his wishes were being fulfilled that morning: there was to be a general engagement in which he was taking part, more than that, he was orderly to the bravest general, and still more, he was going with a message to Kutúzov, perhaps even to the sovereign himself. The morning was bright, he had a good horse under him, and his heart was full of joy and happiness. On receiving the order he gave his horse the rein and galloped along the line. At first he rode along the line of Bagratión&amp;rsquo;s troops, which had not yet advanced into action but were standing motionless; then he came to the region occupied by Uvárov&amp;rsquo;s cavalry and here he noticed a stir and signs of preparation for battle; having passed Uvárov&amp;rsquo;s cavalry he clearly heard the sound of cannon and musketry ahead of him. The firing grew louder and louder.</p>
    <p>In the fresh morning air were now heard, not two or three musket shots at irregular intervals as before, followed by one or two cannon shots, but a roll of volleys of musketry from the slopes of the hill before Pratzen, interrupted by such frequent reports of cannon that sometimes several of them were not separated from one another but merged into a general roar.</p>
    <p>He could see puffs of musketry smoke that seemed to chase one another down the hillsides, and clouds of cannon smoke rolling, spreading, and mingling with one another. He could also, by the gleam of bayonets visible through the smoke, make out moving masses of infantry and narrow lines of artillery with green caissons.</p>
    <p>Rostóv stopped his horse for a moment on a hillock to see what was going on, but strain his attention as he would he could not understand or make out anything of what was happening: there in the smoke men of some sort were moving about, in front and behind moved lines of troops; but why, whither, and who they were, it was impossible to make out. These sights and sounds had no depressing or intimidating effect on him; on the contrary, they stimulated his energy and determination.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Go on! Go on! Give it them!&amp;rdquo; he mentally exclaimed at these sounds, and again proceeded to gallop along the line, penetrating farther and farther into the region where the army was already in action.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;How it will be there I don&amp;rsquo;t know, but all will be well!&amp;rdquo; thought Rostóv.</p>
    <p>After passing some Austrian troops he noticed that the next part of the line (the Guards) was already in action.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;So much the better! I shall see it close,&amp;rdquo; he thought.</p>
    <p>He was riding almost along the front line. A handful of men came galloping toward him. They were our Uhlans who with disordered ranks were returning from the attack. Rostóv got out of their way, involuntarily noticed that one of them was bleeding, and galloped on.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;That is no business of mine,&amp;rdquo; he thought. He had not ridden many hundred yards after that before he saw to his left, across the whole width of the field, an enormous mass of cavalry in brilliant white uniforms, mounted on black horses, trotting straight toward him and across his path. Rostóv put his horse to full gallop to get out of the way of these men, and he would have got clear had they continued at the same speed, but they kept increasing their pace, so that some of the horses were already galloping. Rostóv heard the thud of their hoofs and the jingle of their weapons and saw their horses, their figures, and even their faces, more and more distinctly. They were our Horse Guards, advancing to attack the French cavalry that was coming to meet them.</p>
    <p>The Horse Guards were galloping, but still holding in their horses. Rostóv could already see their faces and heard the command: &amp;ldquo;Charge!&amp;rdquo; shouted by an officer who was urging his thoroughbred to full speed. Rostóv, fearing to be crushed or swept into the attack on the French, galloped along the front as hard as his horse could go, but still was not in time to avoid them.</p>
    <p>The last of the Horse Guards, a huge pockmarked fellow, frowned angrily on seeing Rostóv before him, with whom he would inevitably collide. This Guardsman would certainly have bowled Rostóv and his Bedouin over (Rostóv felt himself quite tiny and weak compared to these gigantic men and horses) had it not occurred to Rostóv to flourish his whip before the eyes of the Guardsman&amp;rsquo;s horse. The heavy black horse, sixteen hands high, shied, throwing back its ears; but the pockmarked Guardsman drove his huge spurs in violently, and the horse, flourishing its tail and extending its neck, galloped on yet faster. Hardly had the Horse Guards passed Rostóv before he heard them shout, &amp;ldquo;Hurrah!&amp;rdquo; and looking back saw that their foremost ranks were mixed up with some foreign cavalry with red epaulets, probably French. He could see nothing more, for immediately afterwards cannon began firing from somewhere and smoke enveloped everything.</p>
    <p>At that moment, as the Horse Guards, having passed him, disappeared in the smoke, Rostóv hesitated whether to gallop after them or to go where he was sent. This was the brilliant charge of the Horse Guards that amazed the French themselves. Rostóv was horrified to hear later that of all that mass of huge and handsome men, of all those brilliant, rich youths, officers and cadets, who had galloped past him on their thousand-ruble horses, only eighteen were left after the charge.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Why should I envy them? My chance is not lost, and maybe I shall see the Emperor immediately!&amp;rdquo; thought Rostóv and galloped on.</p>
    <p>When he came level with the Foot Guards he noticed that about them and around them cannon balls were flying, of which he was aware not so much because he heard their sound as because he saw uneasiness on the soldiers&amp;rsquo; faces and unnatural warlike solemnity on those of the officers.</p>
    <p>Passing behind one of the lines of a regiment of Foot Guards he heard a voice calling him by name.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Rostóv!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;What?&amp;rdquo; he answered, not recognizing Borís.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I say, we&amp;rsquo;ve been in the front line! Our regiment attacked!&amp;rdquo; said Borís with the happy smile seen on the faces of young men who have been under fire for the first time.</p>
    <p>Rostóv stopped.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Have you?&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;Well, how did it go?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;We drove them back!&amp;rdquo; said Borís with animation, growing talkative. &amp;ldquo;Can you imagine it?&amp;rdquo; and he began describing how the Guards, having taken up their position and seeing troops before them, thought they were Austrians, and all at once discovered from the cannon balls discharged by those troops that they were themselves in the front line and had unexpectedly to go into action. Rostóv without hearing Borís to the end spurred his horse.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Where are you off to?&amp;rdquo; asked Borís.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;With a message to His Majesty.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;There he is!&amp;rdquo; said Borís, thinking Rostóv had said &amp;ldquo;His Highness,&amp;rdquo; and pointing to the Grand Duke who with his high shoulders and frowning brows stood a hundred paces away from them in his helmet and Horse Guards&amp;rsquo; jacket, shouting something to a pale, white uniformed Austrian officer.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;But that&amp;rsquo;s the Grand Duke, and I want the commander in chief or the Emperor,&amp;rdquo; said Rostóv, and was about to spur his horse.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Count! Count!&amp;rdquo; shouted Berg who ran up from the other side as eager as Borís. &amp;ldquo;Count! I am wounded in my right hand&amp;rdquo; (and he showed his bleeding hand with a handkerchief tied round it) &amp;ldquo;and I remained at the front. I held my sword in my left hand, Count. All our family&amp;mdash;the von Bergs&amp;mdash;have been knights!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>He said something more, but Rostóv did not wait to hear it and rode away.</p>
    <p>Having passed the Guards and traversed an empty space, Rostóv, to avoid again getting in front of the first line as he had done when the Horse Guards charged, followed the line of reserves, going far round the place where the hottest musket fire and cannonade were heard. Suddenly he heard musket fire quite close in front of him and behind our troops, where he could never have expected the enemy to be.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;What can it be?&amp;rdquo; he thought. &amp;ldquo;The enemy in the rear of our army? Impossible!&amp;rdquo; And suddenly he was seized by a panic of fear for himself and for the issue of the whole battle. &amp;ldquo;But be that what it may,&amp;rdquo; he reflected, &amp;ldquo;there is no riding round it now. I must look for the commander in chief here, and if all is lost it is for me to perish with the rest.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The foreboding of evil that had suddenly come over Rostóv was more and more confirmed the farther he rode into the region behind the village of Pratzen, which was full of troops of all kinds.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;What does it mean? What is it? Whom are they firing at? Who is firing?&amp;rdquo; Rostóv kept asking as he came up to Russian and Austrian soldiers running in confused crowds across his path.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;The devil knows! They&amp;rsquo;ve killed everybody! It&amp;rsquo;s all up now!&amp;rdquo; he was told in Russian, German, and Czech by the crowd of fugitives who understood what was happening as little as he did.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Kill the Germans!&amp;rdquo; shouted one.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;May the devil take them&amp;mdash;the traitors!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p><i>&amp;ldquo;Zum Henker diese Russen!&amp;rdquo;</i> * muttered a German.</p>
    <pre class="testable">* &amp;ldquo;Hang these Russians!&amp;rdquo;</pre>
    <p>Several wounded men passed along the road, and words of abuse, screams, and groans mingled in a general hubbub, then the firing died down. Rostóv learned later that Russian and Austrian soldiers had been firing at one another.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;My God! What does it all mean?&amp;rdquo; thought he. &amp;ldquo;And here, where at any moment the Emperor may see them.... But no, these must be only a handful of scoundrels. It will soon be over, it can&amp;rsquo;t be <i>that</i>, it can&amp;rsquo;t be! Only to get past them quicker, quicker!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The idea of defeat and flight could not enter Rostóv&amp;rsquo;s head. Though he saw French cannon and French troops on the Pratzen Heights just where he had been ordered to look for the commander in chief, he could not, did not wish to, believe <i>that</i>.</p>
    <h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
    <p>Rostóv had been ordered to look for Kutúzov and the Emperor near the village of Pratzen. But neither they nor a single commanding officer were there, only disorganized crowds of troops of various kinds. He urged on his already weary horse to get quickly past these crowds, but the farther he went the more disorganized they were. The highroad on which he had come out was thronged with <i>calèches</i>, carriages of all sorts, and Russian and Austrian soldiers of all arms, some wounded and some not. This whole mass droned and jostled in confusion under the dismal influence of cannon balls flying from the French batteries stationed on the Pratzen Heights.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Where is the Emperor? Where is Kutúzov?&amp;rdquo; Rostóv kept asking everyone he could stop, but got no answer from anyone.</p>
    <p>At last seizing a soldier by his collar he forced him to answer.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Eh, brother! They&amp;rsquo;ve all bolted long ago!&amp;rdquo; said the soldier, laughing for some reason and shaking himself free.</p>
    <p>Having left that soldier who was evidently drunk, Rostóv stopped the horse of a batman or groom of some important personage and began to question him. The man announced that the Tsar had been driven in a carriage at full speed about an hour before along that very road and that he was dangerously wounded.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;It can&amp;rsquo;t be!&amp;rdquo; said Rostóv. &amp;ldquo;It must have been someone else.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I saw him myself,&amp;rdquo; replied the man with a self-confident smile of derision. &amp;ldquo;I ought to know the Emperor by now, after the times I&amp;rsquo;ve seen him in Petersburg. I saw him just as I see you.... There he sat in the carriage as pale as anything. How they made the four black horses fly! Gracious me, they did rattle past! It&amp;rsquo;s time I knew the Imperial horses and Ilyá Iványch. I don&amp;rsquo;t think Ilyá drives anyone except the Tsar!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Rostóv let go of the horse and was about to ride on, when a wounded officer passing by addressed him:</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Who is it you want?&amp;rdquo; he asked. &amp;ldquo;The commander in chief? He was killed by a cannon ball&amp;mdash;struck in the breast before our regiment.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Not killed&amp;mdash;wounded!&amp;rdquo; another officer corrected him.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Who? Kutúzov?&amp;rdquo; asked Rostóv.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Not Kutúzov, but what&amp;rsquo;s his name&amp;mdash;well, never mind... there are not many left alive. Go that way, to that village, all the commanders are there,&amp;rdquo; said the officer, pointing to the village of Hosjeradek, and he walked on.</p>
    <p>Rostóv rode on at a footpace not knowing why or to whom he was now going. The Emperor was wounded, the battle lost. It was impossible to doubt it now. Rostóv rode in the direction pointed out to him, in which he saw turrets and a church. What need to hurry? What was he now to say to the Tsar or to Kutúzov, even if they were alive and unwounded?</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Take this road, your honor, that way you will be killed at once!&amp;rdquo; a soldier shouted to him. &amp;ldquo;They&amp;rsquo;d kill you there!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Oh, what are you talking about?&amp;rdquo; said another. &amp;ldquo;Where is he to go? That way is nearer.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Rostóv considered, and then went in the direction where they said he would be killed.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s all the same now. If the Emperor is wounded, am I to try to save myself?&amp;rdquo; he thought. He rode on to the region where the greatest number of men had perished in fleeing from Pratzen. The French had not yet occupied that region, and the Russians&amp;mdash;the uninjured and slightly wounded&amp;mdash;had left it long ago. All about the field, like heaps of manure on well-kept plowland, lay from ten to fifteen dead and wounded to each couple of acres. The wounded crept together in twos and threes and one could hear their distressing screams and groans, sometimes feigned&amp;mdash;or so it seemed to Rostóv. He put his horse to a trot to avoid seeing all these suffering men, and he felt afraid&amp;mdash;afraid not for his life, but for the courage he needed and which he knew would not stand the sight of these unfortunates.</p>
    <p>The French, who had ceased firing at this field strewn with dead and wounded where there was no one left to fire at, on seeing an adjutant riding over it trained a gun on him and fired several shots. The sensation of those terrible whistling sounds and of the corpses around him merged in Rostóv&amp;rsquo;s mind into a single feeling of terror and pity for himself. He remembered his mother&amp;rsquo;s last letter. &amp;ldquo;What would she feel,&amp;rdquo; thought he, &amp;ldquo;if she saw me here now on this field with the cannon aimed at me?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>In the village of Hosjeradek there were Russian troops retiring from the field of battle, who though still in some confusion were less disordered. The French cannon did not reach there and the musketry fire sounded far away. Here everyone clearly saw and said that the battle was lost. No one whom Rostóv asked could tell him where the Emperor or Kutúzov was. Some said the report that the Emperor was wounded was correct, others that it was not, and explained the false rumor that had spread by the fact that the Emperor&amp;rsquo;s carriage had really galloped from the field of battle with the pale and terrified Ober-Hofmarschal Count Tolstóy, who had ridden out to the battlefield with others in the Emperor&amp;rsquo;s suite. One officer told Rostóv that he had seen someone from headquarters behind the village to the left, and thither Rostóv rode, not hoping to find anyone but merely to ease his conscience. When he had ridden about two miles and had passed the last of the Russian troops, he saw, near a kitchen garden with a ditch round it, two men on horseback facing the ditch. One with a white plume in his hat seemed familiar to Rostóv; the other on a beautiful chestnut horse (which Rostóv fancied he had seen before) rode up to the ditch, struck his horse with his spurs, and giving it the rein leaped lightly over. Only a little earth crumbled from the bank under the horse&amp;rsquo;s hind hoofs. Turning the horse sharply, he again jumped the ditch, and deferentially addressed the horseman with the white plumes, evidently suggesting that he should do the same. The rider, whose figure seemed familiar to Rostóv and involuntarily riveted his attention, made a gesture of refusal with his head and hand and by that gesture Rostóv instantly recognized his lamented and adored monarch.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;But it can&amp;rsquo;t be he, alone in the midst of this empty field!&amp;rdquo; thought Rostóv. At that moment Alexander turned his head and Rostóv saw the beloved features that were so deeply engraved on his memory. The Emperor was pale, his cheeks sunken and his eyes hollow, but the charm, the mildness of his features, was all the greater. Rostóv was happy in the assurance that the rumors about the Emperor being wounded were false. He was happy to be seeing him. He knew that he might and even ought to go straight to him and give the message Dolgorúkov had ordered him to deliver.</p>
    <p>But as a youth in love trembles, is unnerved, and dares not utter the thoughts he has dreamed of for nights, but looks around for help or a chance of delay and flight when the longed-for moment comes and he is alone with <i>her</i>, so Rostóv, now that he had attained what he had longed for more than anything else in the world, did not know how to approach the Emperor, and a thousand reasons occurred to him why it would be inconvenient, unseemly, and impossible to do so.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;What! It is as if I were glad of a chance to take advantage of his being alone and despondent! A strange face may seem unpleasant or painful to him at this moment of sorrow; besides, what can I say to him now, when my heart fails me and my mouth feels dry at the mere sight of him?&amp;rdquo; Not one of the innumerable speeches addressed to the Emperor that he had composed in his imagination could he now recall. Those speeches were intended for quite other conditions, they were for the most part to be spoken at a moment of victory and triumph, generally when he was dying of wounds and the sovereign had thanked him for heroic deeds, and while dying he expressed the love his actions had proved.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Besides how can I ask the Emperor for his instructions for the right flank now that it is nearly four o&amp;rsquo;clock and the battle is lost? No, certainly I must not approach him, I must not intrude on his reflections. Better die a thousand times than risk receiving an unkind look or bad opinion from him,&amp;rdquo; Rostóv decided; and sorrowfully and with a heart full despair he rode away, continually looking back at the Tsar, who still remained in the same attitude of indecision.</p>
    <p>While Rostóv was thus arguing with himself and riding sadly away, Captain von Toll chanced to ride to the same spot, and seeing the Emperor at once rode up to him, offered his services, and assisted him to cross the ditch on foot. The Emperor, wishing to rest and feeling unwell, sat down under an apple tree and von Toll remained beside him. Rostóv from a distance saw with envy and remorse how von Toll spoke long and warmly to the Emperor and how the Emperor, evidently weeping, covered his eyes with his hand and pressed von Toll&amp;rsquo;s hand.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;And I might have been in his place!&amp;rdquo; thought Rostóv, and hardly restraining his tears of pity for the Emperor, he rode on in utter despair, not knowing where to or why he was now riding.</p>
    <p>His despair was all the greater from feeling that his own weakness was the cause of his grief.</p>
    <p>He might... not only might but should, have gone up to the sovereign. It was a unique chance to show his devotion to the Emperor and he had not made use of it.... &amp;ldquo;What have I done?&amp;rdquo; thought he. And he turned round and galloped back to the place where he had seen the Emperor, but there was no one beyond the ditch now. Only some carts and carriages were passing by. From one of the drivers he learned that Kutúzov&amp;rsquo;s staff were not far off, in the village the vehicles were going to. Rostóv followed them. In front of him walked Kutúzov&amp;rsquo;s groom leading horses in horsecloths. Then came a cart, and behind that walked an old, bandy-legged domestic serf in a peaked cap and sheepskin coat.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Tit! I say, Tit!&amp;rdquo; said the groom.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;What?&amp;rdquo; answered the old man absent-mindedly.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Go, Tit! Thresh a bit!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Oh, you fool!&amp;rdquo; said the old man, spitting angrily. Some time passed in silence, and then the same joke was repeated.</p>
    <p>Before five in the evening the battle had been lost at all points. More than a hundred cannon were already in the hands of the French.</p>
    <p>Przebyszéwski and his corps had laid down their arms. Other columns after losing half their men were retreating in disorderly confused masses.</p>
    <p>The remains of Langeron&amp;rsquo;s and Dokhtúrov&amp;rsquo;s mingled forces were crowding around the dams and banks of the ponds near the village of Augesd.</p>
    <p>After five o&amp;rsquo;clock it was only at the Augesd Dam that a hot cannonade (delivered by the French alone) was still to be heard from numerous batteries ranged on the slopes of the Pratzen Heights, directed at our retreating forces.</p>
    <p>In the rearguard, Dokhtúrov and others rallying some battalions kept up a musketry fire at the French cavalry that was pursuing our troops. It was growing dusk. On the narrow Augesd Dam where for so many years the old miller had been accustomed to sit in his tasseled cap peacefully angling, while his grandson, with shirt sleeves rolled up, handled the floundering silvery fish in the watering can, on that dam over which for so many years Moravians in shaggy caps and blue jackets had peacefully driven their two-horse carts loaded with wheat and had returned dusty with flour whitening their carts&amp;mdash;on that narrow dam amid the wagons and the cannon, under the horses&amp;rsquo; hoofs and between the wagon wheels, men disfigured by fear of death now crowded together, crushing one another, dying, stepping over the dying and killing one another, only to move on a few steps and be killed themselves in the same way.</p>
    <p>Every ten seconds a cannon ball flew compressing the air around, or a shell burst in the midst of that dense throng, killing some and splashing with blood those near them.</p>
    <p>Dólokhov&amp;mdash;now an officer&amp;mdash;wounded in the arm, and on foot, with the regimental commander on horseback and some ten men of his company, represented all that was left of that whole regiment. Impelled by the crowd, they had got wedged in at the approach to the dam and, jammed in on all sides, had stopped because a horse in front had fallen under a cannon and the crowd were dragging it out. A cannon ball killed someone behind them, another fell in front and splashed Dólokhov with blood. The crowd, pushing forward desperately, squeezed together, moved a few steps, and again stopped.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Move on a hundred yards and we are certainly saved, remain here another two minutes and it is certain death,&amp;rdquo; thought each one.</p>
    <p>Dólokhov who was in the midst of the crowd forced his way to the edge of the dam, throwing two soldiers off their feet, and ran onto the slippery ice that covered the millpool.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Turn this way!&amp;rdquo; he shouted, jumping over the ice which creaked under him; &amp;ldquo;turn this way!&amp;rdquo; he shouted to those with the gun. &amp;ldquo;It bears!...&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The ice bore him but it swayed and creaked, and it was plain that it would give way not only under a cannon or a crowd, but very soon even under his weight alone. The men looked at him and pressed to the bank, hesitating to step onto the ice. The general on horseback at the entrance to the dam raised his hand and opened his mouth to address Dólokhov. Suddenly a cannon ball hissed so low above the crowd that everyone ducked. It flopped into something moist, and the general fell from his horse in a pool of blood. Nobody gave him a look or thought of raising him.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Get onto the ice, over the ice! Go on! Turn! Don&amp;rsquo;t you hear? Go on!&amp;rdquo; innumerable voices suddenly shouted after the ball had struck the general, the men themselves not knowing what, or why, they were shouting.</p>
    <p>One of the hindmost guns that was going onto the dam turned off onto the ice. Crowds of soldiers from the dam began running onto the frozen pond. The ice gave way under one of the foremost soldiers, and one leg slipped into the water. He tried to right himself but fell in up to his waist. The nearest soldiers shrank back, the gun driver stopped his horse, but from behind still came the shouts: &amp;ldquo;Onto the ice, why do you stop? Go on! Go on!&amp;rdquo; And cries of horror were heard in the crowd. The soldiers near the gun waved their arms and beat the horses to make them turn and move on. The horses moved off the bank. The ice, that had held under those on foot, collapsed in a great mass, and some forty men who were on it dashed, some forward and some back, drowning one another.</p>
    <p>Still the cannon balls continued regularly to whistle and flop onto the ice and into the water and oftenest of all among the crowd that covered the dam, the pond, and the bank.</p>
    <h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
    <p>On the Pratzen Heights, where he had fallen with the flagstaff in his hand, lay Prince Andrew Bolkónski bleeding profusely and unconsciously uttering a gentle, piteous, and childlike moan.</p>
    <p>Toward evening he ceased moaning and became quite still. He did not know how long his unconsciousness lasted. Suddenly he again felt that he was alive and suffering from a burning, lacerating pain in his head.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Where is it, that lofty sky that I did not know till now, but saw today?&amp;rdquo; was his first thought. &amp;ldquo;And I did not know this suffering either,&amp;rdquo; he thought. &amp;ldquo;Yes, I did not know anything, anything at all till now. But where am I?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>He listened and heard the sound of approaching horses, and voices speaking French. He opened his eyes. Above him again was the same lofty sky with clouds that had risen and were floating still higher, and between them gleamed blue infinity. He did not turn his head and did not see those who, judging by the sound of hoofs and voices, had ridden up and stopped near him.</p>
    <p>It was Napoleon accompanied by two aides-de-camp. Bonaparte riding over the battlefield had given final orders to strengthen the batteries firing at the Augesd Dam and was looking at the killed and wounded left on the field.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Fine men!&amp;rdquo; remarked Napoleon, looking at a dead Russian grenadier, who, with his face buried in the ground and a blackened nape, lay on his stomach with an already stiffened arm flung wide.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;The ammunition for the guns in position is exhausted, Your Majesty,&amp;rdquo; said an adjutant who had come from the batteries that were firing at Augesd.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Have some brought from the reserve,&amp;rdquo; said Napoleon, and having gone on a few steps he stopped before Prince Andrew, who lay on his back with the flagstaff that had been dropped beside him. (The flag had already been taken by the French as a trophy.)</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s a fine death!&amp;rdquo; said Napoleon as he gazed at Bolkónski.</p>
    <p>Prince Andrew understood that this was said of him and that it was Napoleon who said it. He heard the speaker addressed as <i>Sire</i>. But he heard the words as he might have heard the buzzing of a fly. Not only did they not interest him, but he took no notice of them and at once forgot them. His head was burning, he felt himself bleeding to death, and he saw above him the remote, lofty, and everlasting sky. He knew it was Napoleon&amp;mdash;his hero&amp;mdash;but at that moment Napoleon seemed to him such a small, insignificant creature compared with what was passing now between himself and that lofty infinite sky with the clouds flying over it. At that moment it meant nothing to him who might be standing over him, or what was said of him; he was only glad that people were standing near him and only wished that they would help him and bring him back to life, which seemed to him so beautiful now that he had today learned to understand it so differently. He collected all his strength, to stir and utter a sound. He feebly moved his leg and uttered a weak, sickly groan which aroused his own pity.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Ah! He is alive,&amp;rdquo; said Napoleon. &amp;ldquo;Lift this young man up and carry him to the dressing station.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Having said this, Napoleon rode on to meet Marshal Lannes, who, hat in hand, rode up smiling to the Emperor to congratulate him on the victory.</p>
    <p>Prince Andrew remembered nothing more: he lost consciousness from the terrible pain of being lifted onto the stretcher, the jolting while being moved, and the probing of his wound at the dressing station. He did not regain consciousness till late in the day, when with other wounded and captured Russian officers he was carried to the hospital. During this transfer he felt a little stronger and was able to look about him and even speak.</p>
    <p>The first words he heard on coming to his senses were those of a French convoy officer, who said rapidly: &amp;ldquo;We must halt here: the Emperor will pass here immediately; it will please him to see these gentlemen prisoners.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;There are so many prisoners today, nearly the whole Russian army, that he is probably tired of them,&amp;rdquo; said another officer.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;All the same! They say this one is the commander of all the Emperor Alexander&amp;rsquo;s Guards,&amp;rdquo; said the first one, indicating a Russian officer in the white uniform of the Horse Guards.</p>
    <p>Bolkónski recognized Prince Repnín whom he had met in Petersburg society. Beside him stood a lad of nineteen, also a wounded officer of the Horse Guards.</p>
    <p>Bonaparte, having come up at a gallop, stopped his horse.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Which is the senior?&amp;rdquo; he asked, on seeing the prisoners.</p>
    <p>They named the colonel, Prince Repnín.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;You are the commander of the Emperor Alexander&amp;rsquo;s regiment of Horse Guards?&amp;rdquo; asked Napoleon.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I commanded a squadron,&amp;rdquo; replied Repnín.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Your regiment fulfilled its duty honorably,&amp;rdquo; said Napoleon.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;The praise of a great commander is a soldier&amp;rsquo;s highest reward,&amp;rdquo; said Repnín.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;I bestow it with pleasure,&amp;rdquo; said Napoleon. &amp;ldquo;And who is that young man beside you?&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Prince Repnín named Lieutenant Sukhtélen.</p>
    <p>After looking at him Napoleon smiled.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;He&amp;rsquo;s very young to come to meddle with us.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Youth is no hindrance to courage,&amp;rdquo; muttered Sukhtélen in a failing voice.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;A splendid reply!&amp;rdquo; said Napoleon. &amp;ldquo;Young man, you will go far!&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Prince Andrew, who had also been brought forward before the Emperor&amp;rsquo;s eyes to complete the show of prisoners, could not fail to attract his attention. Napoleon apparently remembered seeing him on the battlefield and, addressing him, again used the epithet &amp;ldquo;young man&amp;rdquo; that was connected in his memory with Prince Andrew.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;Well, and you, young man,&amp;rdquo; said he. &amp;ldquo;How do you feel, <i>mon brave?</i>&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>Though five minutes before, Prince Andrew had been able to say a few words to the soldiers who were carrying him, now with his eyes fixed straight on Napoleon, he was silent.... So insignificant at that moment seemed to him all the interests that engrossed Napoleon, so mean did his hero himself with his paltry vanity and joy in victory appear, compared to the lofty, equitable, and kindly sky which he had seen and understood, that he could not answer him.</p>
    <p>Everything seemed so futile and insignificant in comparison with the stern and solemn train of thought that weakness from loss of blood, suffering, and the nearness of death aroused in him. Looking into Napoleon&amp;rsquo;s eyes Prince Andrew thought of the insignificance of greatness, the unimportance of life which no one could understand, and the still greater unimportance of death, the meaning of which no one alive could understand or explain.</p>
    <p>The Emperor without waiting for an answer turned away and said to one of the officers as he went: &amp;ldquo;Have these gentlemen attended to and taken to my bivouac; let my doctor, Larrey, examine their wounds. <i>Au revoir</i>, Prince Repnín!&amp;rdquo; and he spurred his horse and galloped away.</p>
    <p>His face shone with self-satisfaction and pleasure.</p>
    <p>The soldiers who had carried Prince Andrew had noticed and taken the little gold icon Princess Mary had hung round her brother&amp;rsquo;s neck, but seeing the favor the Emperor showed the prisoners, they now hastened to return the holy image.</p>
    <p>Prince Andrew did not see how and by whom it was replaced, but the little icon with its thin gold chain suddenly appeared upon his chest outside his uniform.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;It would be good,&amp;rdquo; thought Prince Andrew, glancing at the icon his sister had hung round his neck with such emotion and reverence, &amp;ldquo;it would be good if everything were as clear and simple as it seems to Mary. How good it would be to know where to seek for help in this life, and what to expect after it beyond the grave! How happy and calm I should be if I could now say: &amp;lsquo;Lord, have mercy on me!&amp;rsquo;... But to whom should I say that? Either to a Power indefinable, incomprehensible, which I not only cannot address but which I cannot even express in words&amp;mdash;the Great All or Nothing-&amp;rdquo; said he to himself, &amp;ldquo;or to that God who has been sewn into this amulet by Mary! There is nothing certain, nothing at all except the unimportance of everything I understand, and the greatness of something incomprehensible but all-important.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>The stretchers moved on. At every jolt he again felt unendurable pain; his feverishness increased and he grew delirious. Visions of his father, wife, sister, and future son, and the tenderness he had felt the night before the battle, the figure of the insignificant little Napoleon, and above all this the lofty sky, formed the chief subjects of his delirious fancies.</p>
    <p>The quiet home life and peaceful happiness of Bald Hills presented itself to him. He was already enjoying that happiness when that little Napoleon had suddenly appeared with his unsympathizing look of shortsighted delight at the misery of others, and doubts and torments had followed, and only the heavens promised peace. Toward morning all these dreams melted and merged into the chaos and darkness of unconciousness and oblivion which in the opinion of Napoleon&amp;rsquo;s doctor, Larrey, was much more likely to end in death than in convalescence.</p>
    <p>&amp;ldquo;He is a nervous, bilious subject,&amp;rdquo; said Larrey, &amp;ldquo;and will not recover.&amp;rdquo;</p>
    <p>And Prince Andrew, with others fatally wounded, was left to the care of the inhabitants of the district.</p>
